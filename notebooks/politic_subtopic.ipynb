         "Labour plans maternity pay rise\n\nMaternity pay for new mothers is to rise by £1,400 as part of new proposals announced by the Trade and Industry Secretary Patricia Hewitt.\n\nIt would mean paid leave would be increased to nine months by 2007, Ms Hewitt told GMTV's Sunday programme. Other plans include letting maternity pay be given to fathers and extending rights to parents of older children. The Tories dismissed the maternity pay plan as \"desperate\", while the Liberal Democrats said it was misdirected.\n\nMs Hewitt said: \"We have already doubled the length of maternity pay, it was 13 weeks when we were elected, we have already taken it up to 26 weeks. \"We are going to extend the pay to nine months by 2007 and the aim is to get it right up to the full 12 months by the end of the next Parliament.\" She said new mothers were already entitled to 12 months leave, but that many women could not take it as only six of those months were paid. \"We have made a firm commitment. We will definitely extend the maternity pay, from the six months where it now is to nine months, that's the extra £1,400.\" She said ministers would consult on other proposals that could see fathers being allowed to take some of their partner's maternity pay or leave period, or extending the rights of flexible working to carers or parents of older children. The Shadow Secretary of State for the Family, Theresa May, said: \"These plans were announced by Gordon Brown in his pre-budget review in December and Tony Blair is now recycling it in his desperate bid to win back women voters.\"\n\nShe said the Conservatives would announce their proposals closer to the General Election. Liberal Democrat spokeswoman for women Sandra Gidley said: \"While mothers would welcome any extra maternity pay the Liberal Democrats feel this money is being misdirected.\" She said her party would boost maternity pay in the first six months to allow more women to stay at home in that time.\n\nMs Hewitt also stressed the plans would be paid for by taxpayers, not employers. But David Frost, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, warned that many small firms could be \"crippled\" by the move. \"While the majority of any salary costs may be covered by the government's statutory pay, recruitment costs, advertising costs, retraining costs and the strain on the company will not be,\" he said. Further details of the government's plans will be outlined on Monday. New mothers are currently entitled to 90% of average earnings for the first six weeks after giving birth, followed by £102.80 a week until the baby is six months old.\n",

         "Watchdog probes e-mail deletions\n\nThe information commissioner says he is urgently asking for details of Cabinet Office orders telling staff to delete e-mails more than three months old.\n\nRichard Thomas \"totally condemned\" the deletion of e-mails to prevent their disclosure under freedom of information laws coming into force on 1 January. Government guidance said e-mails should only be deleted if they served \"no current purpose\", Mr Thomas said. The Tories and the Lib Dems have questioned the timing of the new rules.\n\nTory leader Michael Howard has written to Tony Blair demanding an explanation of the new rules on e-mail retention. On Monday Lib Dem constitutional affairs committee chairman Alan Beith warned that the deletion of millions of government e-mails could harm the ability of key probes like the Hutton Inquiry. The timing of the new rules just before the Freedom of Information Act comes into forces was \"too unlikely to have been a coincidence\", Mr Beith said. But a Cabinet Office spokeswoman said the move was not about the new laws or \"the destruction of important records\". Mr Beith urged the information commissioner to look at how the \"e-mail regime\" could \"support the freedom of information regime\".\n\nMr Thomas said: \"The new Act of Parliament makes it very clear that to destroy records in order to prevent their disclosure becomes a criminal offence.\" He said there was already clear guidance on the retention of e-mails contained in a code of practice from the lord chancellor. All e-mails are subject to the freedom of information laws, but the important thing was the content of the e-mail, said Mr Thomas.\n\n\"If in doubt retain, that has been the long-standing principle of the civil service and public authorities. It's only when you've got no further use for the particular record that it may be legitimate to destroy it. \"But any deliberate destruction to avoid the possibility of later disclosure is to be totally condemned.\" The Freedom of Information Act will cover England, Wales and Northern Ireland from next year. Similar measures are being brought in at the same time in Scotland. It provides the public with a right of access to information held by about 100,000 public bodies, subject to various exemptions. Its implementation will be monitored by the information commissioner.\n",

         "Hewitt decries 'career sexism'\n\nPlans to extend paid maternity leave beyond six months should be prominent in Labour's election manifesto, the Trade and Industry Secretary has said.\n\nPatricia Hewitt said the cost of the proposals was being evaluated, but it was an \"increasingly high priority\" and a \"shared goal across government\". Ms Hewitt was speaking at a gender and productivity seminar organised by the Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC). Mothers can currently take up to six months' paid leave - and six unpaid. Ms Hewitt told the seminar: \"Clearly, one of the things we need to do in the future is to extend the period of payment for maternity leave beyond the first six months into the second six months. \"We are looking at how quickly we can do that, because obviously there are cost implications because the taxpayer reimburses the employers for the cost of that.\"\n\nMs Hewitt also announced a new drive to help women who want to work in male dominated sectors, saying sexism at work was still preventing women reaching their full potential. Plans include funding for universities to help female science and engineering graduates find jobs and \"taster courses\" for men and women in non-traditional jobs. Women in full-time work earn 19% less than men, according to the Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC).\n\nThe minister told delegates that getting rid of \"career sexism\" was vital to closing the gender pay gap.\n\n\"Career sexism limits opportunities for women of all ages and prevents them from achieving their full potential. \"It is simply wrong to assume someone cannot do a job on the grounds of their sex,\" she said. Earlier, she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"What we are talking about here is the fact that about six out of 20 women work in jobs that are low-paid and typically dominated by women, so we have got very segregated employment. \"Unfortunately, in some cases, this reflects very old-fashioned and stereotypical ideas about the appropriate jobs for women, or indeed for men. \"Career sexism is about saying that engineering, for instance, where only 10% of employees are women, is really a male-dominated industry. Construction is even worse. \"But it is also about saying childcare jobs are really there for women and not suitable for men. Career sexism goes both ways.\"\n\nShe added that while progress had been made, there was still a gap in pay figures. \"The average woman working full-time is being paid about 80p for every pound a man is earning. For women working part-time it is 60p.\" The Department for Trade and Industry will also provide funding to help a new pay experts panel run by the TUC.\n\nIt has been set up to advise hundreds of companies on equal wage policies. Research conducted by the EOC last year revealed that many Britons believe the pay gap between men and women is the result of \"natural differences\" between the sexes. Women hold less than 10% of the top positions in FTSE 100 companies, the police, the judiciary and trade unions, according to their figures. And retired women have just over half the income of their male counterparts on average.\n",

         "Labour chooses Manchester\n\nThe Labour Party will hold its 2006 autumn conference in Manchester and not Blackpool, it has been confirmed.\n\nThe much trailed decision was ratified by Labour's ruling National Executive Committee in a break with the traditional choice of a seaside venue. It will be the first time since 1917 that the party has chosen Manchester to host the annual event. Blackpool will get the much smaller February spring conference instead in what will be seen as a placatory move.\n\nFor years the main political parties have rotated between Blackpool, Bournemouth and Brighton. And the news the much larger annual conference is not to gather in Blackpool will be seen as a blow in the coastal resort. In 1998 the party said it would not return to Blackpool but did so in 2002. The following year Bournemouth hosted the event before the party signed a two year deal for Brighton to host the autumn conference.\n\nColin Asplin, Blackpool Hotel Association said: \"We have tried very hard to make sure they come back to Blackpool. \"Obviously we have failed in that. I just hope Manchester can handle the crowds. \"It amazes me that the Labour Party, which is a working class party, doesn't want to come to the main working class resort in the country.\" The exact cost to Blackpool in terms of lost revenue for hotel accommodation is not yet known but it is thought that block bookings will be taken at the major Manchester hotels after the official announcement.\n",

         "Brown ally rejects Budget spree\n\nChancellor Gordon Brown's closest ally has denied suggestions there will be a Budget giveaway on 16 March.\n\nEd Balls, ex-chief economic adviser to the Treasury, said there would be no spending spree before polling day. But Mr Balls, a prospective Labour MP, said he was confident the chancellor would meet his fiscal rules. He was speaking as Sir Digby Jones, CBI director general, warned Mr Brown not to be tempted to use any extra cash on pre-election bribes.\n\nMr Balls, who stepped down from his Treasury post to stand as a Labour candidate in the election, had suggested that Mr Brown would meet his golden economic rule - \"with a margin to spare\". He said he hoped more would be done to build on current tax credit rules.\n\nHe also stressed rise in interest rates ahead of an expected May election would not affect the Labour Party's chances of winning. Expectations of a rate rise have gathered pace after figures showed house prices are still rising. Consumer borrowing rose at a near-record pace in January. \"If the MPC (the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee) were to judge that a rate rise was justified before the election because of the strength of the economy - and I'm not predicting that they will - I do not believe that this will be a big election issue in Britain for Labour,\" he told a Parliamentary lunch. \"This is a big change in our political culture.\"\n\nDuring an interview with BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Balls said he was sure Mr Brown's Budget would not put at risk the stability of the economy. \"I don't think we'll see a pre-election spending spree - we certainly did not see that before 2001,\" he said.\n\nHis assurances came after Sir Digby Jones said stability was all important and any extra cash should be spent on improving workers' skills. His message to the chancellor was: \"Please don't give it away in any form of electioneering.\" Sir Digby added: \"I don't think he will. I have to say he has been a prudent chancellor right the way through. Stability is the key word - British business needs boring stability more than anything. \"We would say to him 'don't increase your public spending, don't give it away. But if you are going to anywhere, just add something to the competitiveness of Britain, put it into skilling our people'. \"That would be a good way to spend any excess.\"\n\nMr Balls refused to say whether Mr Brown would remain as chancellor after the election, amid speculation he will be offered the job of Foreign Secretary. \"I think that Gordon Brown wants to be part of the successful Labour government which delivers in the third term for the priorities of the people and sees off a Conservative Party that will take Britain backwards,\" Mr Balls told Today. Prime Minister Tony Blair has yet to name the date of the election, but most pundits are betting on 5 May.\n",

         "'Errors' doomed first Dome sale\n\nThe initial attempt to sell the Millennium Dome failed due to a catalogue of errors, a report by the government's finance watchdog says.\n\nThe report said too many parties were involved in decision-making when the attraction first went on sale after the Millennium exhibition ended. The National Audit Office said the Dome cost taxpayers £28.7m to maintain and sell in the four years after it closed. Finally, a deal to turn it into a sport and entertainment venue was struck. More than £550m could now be returned to the public sector in the wake of the deal to regenerate the site in Greenwich, London.\n\nThe NAO report said that this sale went through because it avoided many of the problems of the previous attempt to sell the Dome. Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott said a good deal had been secured. \"Delivery of the many benefits secured through this deal will continue the substantial progress already made at the Millennium Village and elsewhere on the peninsula,\" he said. But Edward Leigh, who is chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, warned the government would have to work hard to ensure taxpayers would get full benefit from the Dome deal. He said: \"This report also shows that the first attempt to sell the Dome proved a complete fiasco. Every arm of government seems to have had a finger in the pie. The process was confused and muddled.\" He added: \"Four years after the Millennium Exhibition closed, the Government finally has a deal to find a use for what has been a white elephant since it closed in a deal that, incredible as it may seem, should bring in some money and provide a benefit for the local area and the country as whole. However, it was more a question of luck that a strong bid turned up after thefirst abortive attempt.\" NAO head Sir John Bourn said: \"In difficult circumstances following the failure of the first competition, English Partnerships and the office of the deputy prime minister have worked hard to get a deal.\"\n",

         "Fox attacks Blair's Tory 'lies'\n\nTony Blair lied when he took the UK to war so has no qualms about lying in the election campaign, say the Tories.\n\nTory co-chairman Liam Fox was speaking after Mr Blair told Labour members the Tories offered a \"hard right agenda\". Dr Fox told BBC Radio: \"If you are willing to lie about the reasons for going to war, I guess you are going to lie about anything at all.\" He would not discuss reports the party repaid £500,000 to Lord Ashcroft after he predicted an election defeat.\n\nThe prime minister ratcheted up Labour's pre-election campaigning at the weekend with a helicopter tour of the country and his speech at the party's spring conference. He insisted he did not know the poll date, but it is widely expected to be 5 May.\n\nIn what was seen as a highly personal speech in Gateshead on Sunday, Mr Blair said: \"I have the same passion and hunger as when I first walked through the door of 10 Downing Street.\" He described his relationship with the public as starting euphoric, then struggling to live up to the expectations, and reaching the point of raised voices and \"throwing crockery\". He warned his supporters against complacency, saying: \"It's a fight for the future of our country, it's a fight that for Britain and the people of Britain we have to win.\"\n\nMr Blair said that whether the public chose Michael Howard or Mr Kennedy, it would result in \"a Tory government not a Labour government and a country that goes back and does not move forward\". Dr Fox accused Mr Blair and other Cabinet ministers of telling lies about their opponents' policies and then attacking the lies. \"What we learned at the weekend is what Labour tactics are going to be and it's going to be fear and smear,\" he told BBC News. The Tory co-chairman attacked Labour's six new pledges as \"vacuous\" and said Mr Blair was very worried voters would take revenge for his failure to deliver. Dr Fox refused to discuss weekend newspaper reports that the party had repaid £500,000 to former Tory Treasurer Lord Ashcroft after he said the party could not win the election. \"We repay loans when they are due but do not comment to individual financial matters,\" he said, insisting he enjoyed a \"warm and constructive\" relationship to Lord Ashcroft.\n\nMeanwhile Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy is expected to attack Mr Blair's words as he begins a nationwide tour on Monday. Mr Kennedy is accelerating Lib Dem election preparations this week as he visits Manchester, Liverpool, Leicester, Somerset, Basingstoke, Shrewsbury, Dorset and Torbay. He said: \"This is three-party politics. In the northern cities, the contest is between Labour and the Liberal Democrats. \"In southern and rural seats - especially in the South West - the principal contenders are the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives, who are out of the running in Scotland and Wales.\" The Lib Dems accuse Mr Blair of making a \"touchy-feely\" speech to Labour delegates which will not help him regain public trust.\n",

         "Women MPs reveal sexist taunts\n\nWomen MPs endure \"shocking\" levels of sexist abuse at the hands of their male counterparts, a new study shows.\n\nMale MPs pretended to juggle imaginary breasts and jeered \"melons\" as women made Commons speeches, researchers from Birkbeck College were told. Labour's Yvette Cooper said she found it hard to persuade Commons officials she was a minister and not a secretary. Some 83 MPs gave their answers in 100 hours of taped interviews for the study \"Whose Secretary are You, minister\".\n\nThe research team, under Professor Joni Lovenduski, had set out to look at the achievements and experiences of women at Westminster. But what emerged was complaints from MPs of all parties of sexist barracking in the Chamber, sexist insults and patronising assumptions about their abilities. Barbara Follet, one of the so-called \"Blair Babes\" elected in 1997, told researchers: \"I remember some Conservatives - whenever a Labour woman got up to speak they would take their breasts - imaginary breasts - in their hands and wiggle them and say 'melons' as we spoke.\" Former Liberal Democrat MP Jackie Ballard recalled a stream of remarks from a leading MP on topics such as women's legs or their sexual persuasion. And ex-Tory education secretary Gillian Shepherd remembered how one of her male colleagues called all women \"Betty\".\n\n\"When I said, 'Look you know my name isn't Betty', he said, 'ah but you're all the same, so I call you all Betty'.\" Harriet Harman told researchers of the sheer hostility prompted by her advancement to the Cabinet: \"Well, you've only succeeded because you're a woman.\" Another current member of the Cabinet says she was told: \"Oh, you've had a very fast rise, who have you been sleeping with?\" Even after the great influx of women MPs at the 1997 general election, and greater numbers of women in the Cabinet, female MPs often say they feel stuck on the edge of a male world.\n\nLiberal Democrat Sarah Teather, the most recent female MP to be elected, told researchers: \"Lots of people say it's like an old boys club. \"I've always said to me it feels more like a teenage public school - you know a public school full of teenagers.\" Prof Joni Lovenduski, who conducted the study with the help of Margaret Moran MP and a team of journalists, said she was shocked at the findings. \"We expected a bit of this but nothing like this extent. We expected to find a couple of shocking episodes.\" But she said there was a difference between the experiences of women before the 1997 intake and afterwards. This was mainly because there were more women present in Parliament who were not prepared to \"put up with\" the sexist attitudes they came across, Prof Lovenduski said. But she added: \"Some women, including the women who came in 1997, received extraordinary treatment and I am not convinced that if the number of women changed back to what it was before 1997 that things would not change back. \"What I think is shocking to the general public is that these things go on in the House of Commons.\" The interviews are to be placed in the British Library as a historical record.\n",

He later contacted the show saying the original e-mail had been sent in error and that it was all a \"silly fuss\". Mr Campbell has recently re-joined Labour's election campaign.\n\nThe e-mail was revealed the day after Peter Mandelson, former Labour minister and now a European Commissioner, warned the BBC to steer away from \"demonising\" Mr Campbell. Mr Campbell messaged Newsnight after the programme investigated claims that Labour's advertising agency TBWA was blaming him for controversy over its campaign posters. The images, including one of flying pigs and another of what critics claim depicted Tory leader Michael Howard as Fagin, prompted accusations of anti-Semitism, claims denied by Labour.\n\nMr Campbell's e-mail, which was apparently intended for a party official, suggested they should get Trevor Beattie, TBWA's boss, to issue a statement. In it, he said: \"Just spoke to trev. think tbwa shd give statement to newsnight saying party and agency work together well and nobody here has spoken to standard. Posters done by by tbwa according to political brief. Now fuck off and cover something important you twats!\" The e-mail was sent by mistake to Newsnight journalist Andrew McFadyen. Realising his error, Mr Campbell then e-mailed Mr McFadyen pointing out the mistake, but suggesting presenter Jeremy Paxman would have seen the funny side.\n\nHe said: \"Not very good at this e-mail Blackberry malarkey. Just looked at log of sent messages, have realised e-mail meant for colleagues at TBWA has gone to you. For the record, first three sentences of email spot on. No row between me and trevor. \"Posters done by them according to our brief. I dreamt up flying pigs. Pigs not great but okay in the circs of Tories promising tax cuts and spending rises with the same money. TBWA made production. \"Campbell swears shock. Final sentence of earlier e-mail probably a bit colourful and personal considering we have never actually met but I'm sure you share the same sense of humour as your star presenter Mr P. \"Never known such a silly fuss since the last silly fuss but there we go. Must look forward not back.\"\n\nLater the prime minister's spokesman was asked by journalists about his view on Mr Campbell's use of abusive language. The spokesman said: \"The person you are referring to is capable of speaking for himself and he no longer works in government.\" Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said he had always had \"very good and polite relations\" with Mr Campbell, who he described as \"very talented\". But on the former spin doctor's use of language, Mr Straw said: \"I do know the odd journalist who has occasionally used the odd word that would probably be inappropriate in some circumstances. Maybe I mix with the wrong kind of journalists.\" Liam Fox, Tory co-chairman, said the return of Mr Campbell was a sign of new \"sinister and underhand tactics\" by Labour.\n",

         "PM apology over jailings\n\nTony Blair has apologised to two families who suffered one of the UK's biggest miscarriages of justice.\n\nThe prime minister was commenting on the wrongful jailing of 11 people for IRA bomb attacks on pubs in Guildford and Woolwich in 1974. Mr Blair said: \"I am very sorry that they were subject to such an ordeal and injustice.\" He made the apology to members of the Conlon and Maguire families in his private room at Westminster. In a statement recorded for television, Mr Blair said the families deserved \"to be completely and publicly exonerated\".\n\nThe families had hoped the apology would be made during Prime Minister's Questions in the House of Commons. However, one of the so-called Guildford Four, Gerry Conlon - who was wrongly convicted of planting the bombs - said the families were delighted with the apology. He said Mr Blair had spoken with \"such sincerity\", adding: \"He went beyond what we thought he would, he took time to listen to everyone. \"You could see he was moved by what people were saying. \"Tony Blair has healed rifts, he is helping to heal wounds. It's a day I never thought would come.\" The move followed a huge campaign in Ireland for a public apology after eleven people were wrongly convicted of making and planting the IRA bombs which killed seven people. Mr Blair's official spokesman said no-one present at the meeting would \"ever forget the strength of feeling of relief that the prime minister's statement brought to them\".\n\nMost of those convicted were either members or friends of the two families. All were arrested because of a family connection to Gerry Conlon. Mr Conlon's father Giuseppe was arrested when travelling to London from Belfast to help his son. He died while serving his sentence. Also arrested were Anne Maguire and members of her family. Mrs Maguire was the relative with whom Giuseppe planned to stay in London, as well as two family friends. She said it was a \"wonderful feeling\" to have had the apology and that a weight had been lifted off her shoulders.\n\n\"The people who were still doubting us should now believe that we were totally innocent,\" she said. They were all jailed for handling explosives, based on scientific evidence which was later entirely discredited. In October 1989 the Court of Appeal quashed the sentences of the Guildford Four, and in June 1991 it overturned the sentences on the Maguire Seven. Mr Conlon's case was highlighted in the Oscar-nominated film In The Name Of The Father, starring Daniel Day-Lewis.\n",

         "Howard rebuts asylum criticisms\n\nTory leader Michael Howard has gone on the offensive in response to people questioning how a son of immigrants can propose asylum quotas.\n\nMr Howard, whose parents fled the Nazi threat to come to the UK, says the claim would mean no-one from an immigrant family could become premier. His comments come in a BBC documentary called 'No More Mr Nasty'. TV presenter Anne Robinson said as home secretary he gave the impression he would \"like to kick your cat\". Ms Robinson, a friend of the Tory leader, also revealed that as a Cambridge student Mr Howard was \"much loved by women and he was a courteous and kind and rather dashing lover\" - although she denied having personal experience. \"I wasn't at Cambridge - and it's not personal experience - but I know people who were.\"\n\nDocumentary maker Michael Cockerell was given behind-the-scenes access to Mr Howard for his film portrait. The Tory leader was asked about to respond to people who said that if there had there been a quota on immigration and asylum in the 1930s, his parents might not have been allowed into the country.\n\nHe replies: \"What is the inference of that? \"That if you reach the view that you need to control immigration in the interests of the country you're not allowed to put a view forward if you happen to be descended from immigrants? \"That seems to me an absolutely extraordinary proposition? It would certainly mean no one from immigrant parents could be prime minister.\"\n\nMs Robinson, who presents The Weakest Link tells Cockerell that she despaired at his hardline image when he was home secretary in John Major's government. \"I used to have to sit on my hands because he'd get on television and give a passable impression of someone who'd like to kick your cat or would put your baby in prison if he cried. I mean it was very, very Draconian.\" The film shows Mr Howard laughing at Rory Bremner's impression of him as Dracula, which he calls \"good fun\", apart from the serious falsehood of a comment suggesting he wants fewer black people in the UK. The film shows the private side of the Tory leader watching television at home or playing table tennis with his wife, ex-model Sandra. Asked if she enjoys a game of ping pong she confesses: \"Yeah, it would be more enjoyable if I could win occasionally too, but otherwise it's quite fun.\"\n\nFormer Downing Street communications chief Alastair Campbell, now working on Labour's election campaign, says a \"touchy-feely\" image does not fit Mr Howard. He says Tony Blair was not worried by his opponents' early performance in their Commons clashes because Mr Howard lacked a \"big strategy\", including on issues like Iraq. The Tory leader brands such criticisms as \"absolutely rubbish\", arguing that he has been consistent on his support for the war but critical of Mr Blair's failure to tell the truth on intelligence. Former Tory chancellor Ken Clarke says Mr Howard has a bigger problem changing perceptions of the Tory party than his personal image. Mr Clarke says the party is improving and it is \"conceivable\" it could win the next election. But he adds: \"It has got to change itself a bit and broaden its appeal.\"\n\n- Michael Howard: No More Mr Nasty is being shown on BBC2 on Saturday 12 February at 2005 GMT.\n",

         "Blair rejects Tory terror offer\n\nTony Blair has rejected a Conservative compromise offer that could have eased the passage of anti-terror legislation.\n\nThe Tories wanted a sunset clause inserted in the Anti-Terrorism Bill that would have forced ministers to revisit it in November. Mr Blair said the bill, which brings in house arrest for terror suspects, had time limiting safeguards already. The Tories say they will vote against it unless changes they want are agreed. The Lib Dems also oppose the plans.\n\nThe government has already given way over the role of judges in house arrest cases.\n\nMr Blair's refusal to accept the Tories' sunset clause proposals means that the government faces concerted opposition from all sides in the Lords. Peers begin three days of detailed deliberation on the bill on Thursday. The bill proposes \"control orders\", which as well as placing terrorism suspects under house arrest could mean curfews, tagging or bans on telephone and internet use. These would replace current powers to detain foreign terror suspects without trial, which the law lords have ruled against as a breach of human rights.\n\nThe Tories want judicial oversight of all control orders, not just house arrest. Shadow Home Secretary David Davis told BBC Radio Four's the World at One his primary concern was potential miscarriages of justice. He said if someone was wrongly given a control order it would act as a \"recruiting sergeant\" for terrorists. He went on to say: \"If we don't get the amendments we regard as essential, including the sunset clause, we will vote against the bill.\" In the Commons, Mr Howard said it would be \"far better if the whole of the legislation was subject to a sunset clause so Parliament could consider it all in a proper way instead of it being ramrodded through\". Mr Blair said the house arrest powers were already going to be subject to a sunset clause because it was annually renewable.\n\nThe second, less stringent, type of control orders would be subject to a court appeal within 14 days and there would be a three-monthly report on their use by \"an eminent and independent person\". \"I believe (the new powers) are a proper balance between the civil liberties of the subject and the necessary national security of this country that I will not put at risk,\" said Mr Blair. The Lib Dems plan to oppose the Bill in the Lords on Thursday. Lib Dem home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten said: \"There's a lot of talking left. I would be uneasy about supporting a very bad bill even if it was just for eight months.\" A spokeswoman for Human Rights Watch said it was a \"basic principle\" that people should only be punished after a fair trial. She added: \"Having a judge impose those punishments without a trial does not sanitise them either.\"\n",

The committee was reporting on the work, strategy and spending plans of the Economic Social Research Council.\n\nThe council aims to promote and support strategic research for social science postgraduates and provide social scientists to meet the needs of the country. It also liaises with the government and industry over their social science needs. In its report on the council's work the committee said: \"We are deeply concerned by the skills shortages afflicting, in particular, the qualitative branches of social sciences. This mirrored previous concerns the committee had expressed on shortages in the fields of maths and chemistry, it said. \"It is hard to see how significant progress towards rectifying these shortages can be made through the deployment of Economic and Social Research Council's limited resources. \"If the government is serious about addressing skills shortages in key subjects it needs to find a more effective mechanism to achieve this.\" A national \"strategic capabilities fund\" to address shortages in key areas should be set up in response, the committee added.\n",

The deal is thought to have been hammered out on Thursday night after Japan, one of the biggest creditor nations, finally signed up to it. Mr Brown first proposed the idea earlier this week.\n\nG8 ministers are also believed to have agreed to instruct the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to complete a country by country analysis of the reconstruction problems faced by all states hit by the disaster. Mr Brown has been locked in talks with finance ministers of the G8, which Britain now chairs. Germany also proposed a freeze and Canada has begun its own moratorium.

Between 1.1 and 1.5 million people, mainly Jews, were killed at Auschwitz. The Tories said they were glad Mr Straw had been \"shamed\" into going, having earlier criticised the decision to send a lower-ranking official. Shadow Foreign Secretary Michael Ancram said: \"I am glad the foreign secretary has finally been shamed into representing Britain at this important act of commemoration. \"Once again this government has shown crass insensitivity until it has been forced by public opinion into doing what it should have done in the first place.\"\n\nIn Britain, the Queen and Prince Philip will lead the nation's commemoration at a service in Westminster Hall, London. The Queen will also host a reception for holocaust survivors at St James's Palace. Altogether, some six million people, mainly Jews, perished in the Holocaust. The Queen's grandson, Prince Harry, sparked outrage earlier this week after photographs of him wearing a Nazi uniform at a costume party emerged. The prince, 20, apologised, but critics have called for him to go to Auschwitz for the commemoration of the Soviets' 1945 liberation of the camp. Prince Harry should see for himself \"the results of the hated symbol he so foolishly and brazenly chose to wear\", Rabbi Marvin Hier, founder of Jewish human rights group the Simon Wiesenthal Center said.\n",

         "Drink remark 'acts as diversion'\n\nThe first minister's statement that it was okay to get drunk \"once in a while\" has diverted attention from the real issues, it has been claimed.\n\nJack Law, chief executive of Alcohol Focus Scotland, said Jack McConnell's comment was \"ill-advised\". The media attention had helped to move the focus from Scotland's binge drinking problems, Mr Law said. Scotsman journalist Hamish MacDonell said he believed the bigger picture had been \"obscured\" by the remark. Mr McConnell was speaking on Monday to more than 100 secondary pupils from schools in the Highlands about the problems of binge drinking and drink promotions.\n\nThe one-sentence comment was immediately criticised by the Scottish National Party which accused him of encouraging young people to get drunk. But the Scottish Executive has insisted Mr McConnell was speaking about adults and his comments were \"a recognition that people will get drunk\". Mr MacDonell, political editor of The Scotsman, said: \"I think we have to say right at the outset that this was a very stupid and ill-advised remark by the first minister. \"If you come out with something like this, saying that by all means get drunk, then you will be pilloried for it.\" However, he added that \"perhaps Mr McConnell could feel rightly aggrieved about the coverage\".\n\nMr MacDonell said: \"I think the problem here is that he did say a lot more things about binge drinking and under age drinking. \"But that whole side of things has been lost in the furore over one sentence. I understand why, but I think there is a much bigger message here that has been obscured.\" Mr Law, from voluntary body Alcohol Focus Scotland, believed damage had been done to Scotland's fight against binge drinking. He said he accepted that young people drank and they did have problems with drink. Mr Law added: \"I think the remark was ill-advised - but these remarks are blown out of all proportion and they so easily misrepresent what we are trying to do in Scotland.\n\n\"We don't want to preach to young people, but we need to acknowledge that they do drink problematically. \"This diverts us from the real issues which are about promoting responsibility and reducing harm and indeed tackling our drinking culture which is a culture about binge drinking and drunkenness.\" He said it was vital that young people were properly informed about the risks incurred to themselves and others when they got drunk. Mr MacDonell said that the first minister should know by now that if he said things which were \"off the mark\", they were bound to \"come back and bite him\". He added: \"Here, Mr McConnell was talking in the Highlands to 100 teenagers and every word he said was put out on a webcast by the Scottish Executive and then looked at by other politicians and reporters. \"I think in this instance he has done a lot of really good things and he will be regretting this remark.\"\n\nThe Scottish National Party's Holyrood leader Nicola Sturgeon wrote to Mr McConnell on Tuesday accusing him of an error of judgement and calling for him to apologise for his \"ill-judged comment\" and withdraw it immediately. In a furious response, the first minister said his comments had been distorted and taken out of context. He told Ms Sturgeon: \"It is disappointing that you have contributed to this distortion by saying it is staggering that I 'should encourage young people to get drunk'. \"That is completely untrue. Perhaps it would have been wiser for you to find out what was actually said before you rushed to represent my position, undermine the convener of education at Highland Council and insult the intelligence of the young people I spoke with - all for the sake of a simple soundbite.\"\n",

         "Concerns at school diploma plan\n\nFinal appeals are being made for the government not to ditch the reform plan for England's secondary schools put forward by the Tomlinson report.\n\nThe government's response to the plan for a four-tier diploma to replace all existing 14-19 qualifications is expected next week. Some are worried it could be scuppered if, as Tony Blair and Ruth Kelly have suggested, GCSEs and A-levels stay. Sir Mike Tomlinson himself was briefed only this week. He is said to be feeling more comfortable about what the government is likely to say than if he had read only what was in newspapers in the earlier part of the week. But the government was said to be still rewriting its response on Friday. \"It will be a tragedy if the government comes through with a half-hearted response,\" said the chairman of the Commons education select committee, Labour MP Barry Sheerman.\n\nHis main concern was the reports that there would be a diploma - but only to replace existing vocational qualifications. \"We must tackle head-on the structural mess that is our secondary education system,\" he wrote in the Times Educational Supplement. \"It is not the case that the academic stream in secondary is fine while the vocational route is desperately weak.\" The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA) has also told the government not to \"compromise\". The QCA said the potential \"step-change in participation and attainment\" lay in the integrity of the whole diploma. \"Any partial implementation of the proposals would, in our view, compromise that integrity,\" said its chairman, Sir Anthony Greener. It is a sign of the QCA's concern that its advice went to ministers last December but was publicised only recently. But people understand that a White Paper response is government policy and has to command wider ministerial support than if it were coming only from the Department for Education and Skills. They may be content if it does not \"close too many doors\" in writing - whatever spin is put on it.\n\nThe chief inspector of schools, David Bell, also said recently that GCSEs and A-levels should go. \"One of the reasons why I'm so strongly in favour of these terms disappearing over time is that it's good for the symbols of change to be seen right across the system,\" he said. \"If we don't say this is a sea-change in education, we will miss a great opportunity.\" Universities and head teachers in both the independent and state sectors have also backed the Tomlinson proposals, which include having higher grades at advanced level to differentiate between the brightest students. A note of concern has been expressed repeatedly by the employers' organisation, the CBI, which complains of a lack of skills. In an attempt to address this, the Tomlinson plan is for tests in \"functional\" maths and literacy - decidedly not GCSEs. It has been suggested the government will take steps of some sort to meet firms' concerns on this score. Another dissenter is Sir Mike Tomlinson's predecessor as chief schools inspector, Professor Chris Woodhead, who has said there is no need for such a \"massive upheaval\". The Conservative Party has put forward plans to revert to a system of having only the brightest percentage of students each year getting the top A-level grade, no matter how well the others have done.\n",

         "Blair backs 'pre-election budget'\n\nTony Blair has backed Chancellor Gordon Brown's pre-Budget report amid opposition claims he was too bullish about the state of the UK economy.\n\nIn a speech in Edinburgh, the prime minister said Thursday's report reinforced stability and opportunity. And that would be central to Labour's next election campaign, planning for which was already well advanced. Mr Brown earlier denied his economic forecasts were too optimistic - but refused to rule out future tax rises.\n\nHe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"No politician should make the mistake that John Major and his colleagues made in 1992 of saying no matter what the circumstances are, they can make all sorts of guarantees on every individual thing.\n\n\"That is not what politicians should do, it would not be responsible to do.\" Mr Brown insisted his spending plans were \"affordable\" and he could afford to be optimistic because Britain was now a stable, low-inflation economy and house prices were now stabilising. Mr Blair praised his chancellor for his role in creating economic stability, which he said was the \"cornerstone\" of Labour's programme.\n\nIn a speech at Edinburgh's Napier University, he said Labour would publish over the next few months \"a rich agenda for future policy in any possible third term\".\n\n\"In every area of work there is a detailed plan for the future, much clearer than those in 1997 or 2001. All of it fits together around common themes of opportunity, security and stability for all,\" Mr Blair said. In his pre-Budget report, Mr Brown surprised some City experts by forecasting UK growth at between 3% and 3.5% for next year. Many believe the figure is more likely to be under 3% - and fear tax rises or spending cuts, saying tax receipts have been overestimated. Carl Emmerson, from the Institute for Fiscal Studies, told BBC News: \"He thinks everything will come out in the wash and it will, in fact, be OK. We're not so sure.\" David Page, of Investec Securities, said: \"His forecast that he will meet the golden rule with a margin of £8bn is way too optimistic. \"It's going to take a significant turnaround in the economy to meet these targets.\"\n\nConservative Shadow chancellor Oliver Letwin said: \"I can't find a single economic forecaster from the IMF to the Institute of Fiscal Studies who believes anything other than the chancellor has got a black hole in his finances. \"In order to deal with that he will have to raise taxes after the next general election.\" Mr Letwin accused the chancellor of using \"fancy statistics\" to hide public service failures. Vincent Cable, for the Liberal Democrats, called on Mr Brown to open up the government's books to the National Audit Office, to see if he had met his \"golden rule\". \"It is very clear that there are some serious loose ends in government public spending,\" Mr Cable told MPs.\n",

Prime minister's questions also saw Mr Blair predict that new plans would probably cut net immigration. He attacked Tory plans to process asylum claims abroad - but Mr Howard said Labour had proposed the idea too.\n\nThe Commons questions session again saw the leaders of the two biggest parties shape up for the forthcoming election campaign. The Tories have promised £4bn in tax cuts but have yet to say where they will fall. Mr Howard pointed to the Institute for Fiscal Studies' predictions that Labour will need to increase taxes to cover an £11bn gap in its spending plans. He accused ministers of wasting money on unsuccessful attempts to curb bad behaviour and truancy in schools and on slow asylum processing. It was no good Mr Blair claiming tax pledges were being left to the manifesto as he had given one to MPs on Tuesday about the top rate of income tax, argued Mr Howard. Pointing to national insurance, he added: \"Everyone knows tax will go up under Labour: isn't it now clear which tax it would be?\"\n\nMr Blair instead hailed Labour's achievement in using a strong economy to invest in public services. \"When we have money not only going into extra teachers and nurses but equipment in schools and hospitals, that money is not wasted,\" he said. On the tax questions, he added: \"We will make commitments on tax at the time of the manifesto.\" Home Secretary Charles Clarke this week published plans for a new points system for economic migrants, with only high-skilled workers allowed into the UK from outside the European Union.\n\nMr Blair said abuses would be weeded out and chain migration, where families automatically get the right to settle with immigrant workers, would end. That would probably create a fall in the migrant numbers, he said. The prime minister ridiculed the Tory plans for asylum quotas and for processing all asylum claims overseas. He challenged the Tories on which country would house their processing centres - what he called a \"fantasy island\". Mr Howard read from a letter about the government's own plans at the European Council of Ministers for processing asylum seekers outside the EU. But Mr Blair said: \"All the other countries could not agree on the way forward, nor could the UN.\"\n",

Chief executive John Beaumont was paid a bonus of £44,914, despite a failure to bring in private sector backers. The Commons education select committee called this \"morally indefensible\" but the government said the e-University project had \"improved understanding\".\n\nA Department for Education and Skills spokeswoman said the venture had been \"ambitious and ground-breaking, but take-up had not been \"sufficient to continue with the project\". She added: \"UK e-Universities was not the only organisation to have lost out on private sector investment in the collapse of the dotcom boom.\" The select committee found that those responsible for founding the e-University in 2000 had been caught up in the \"general atmosphere of enthusiasm\" surrounding the internet. Initial business plans forecast a quarter of a million students joining within a decade, bringing in at least £110m in profit.\n\nBut virtually no market research was carried out and just £4.2m was spent on worldwide sales and marketing of courses. Some £14m went on developing the technology to make the e-University work. This was used by just 200 students, the rest preferring to work through existing university websites. With no significant private investors and no direct accountability to a government minister, the e-University had had \"too much freedom to spend public money as it wished\", the report found. Committee chairman Barry Sheerman said: \"UK e-University was a terrible waste of public money. \"The senior executives failed to interest any private investors and showed an extraordinary over-confidence in their ability to attract students to the scheme.\" The report warns that the government should not be scared off investment in innovative but potentially risky schemes by the failure of the e-University, but \"should learn the lessons from this disaster\".\n",

He will see an HIV/Aids orphanage in Tanzania and a women's credit union in Mozambique before chairing a meeting of the Commission for Africa in Cape Town. At slums in Narobi on Wednesday, he said education needs had to be tackled.\n\nSpeaking outside the Olympic Primary School, Mr Brown said: \"It is simply not acceptable in the modern age for the rest of the world to stand by and have hundreds of millions of children not getting the chance at education.\" He pointed to international plans to invest $10bn for education in Africa over the next decade. The school is on the edge of Kibera, where 800,000 live often in huts made of mud, scrap metal and cardboard. Mr Brown's aides say he wants to find out more about the Kenyan Government's education policies, which included introducing free primary education in early 2003. The chancellor has already unveiled proposals for a G8 aid package which he has likened to the Marshall Plan used by the United States to rebuild Europe after World War Two. The trip follows claims of infighting between Mr Brown and Tony Blair detailed in a new book.

She said this would counter \"so-called independent\" groups like Migration Watch, which she described as an anti-immigration body posing as independent. Migration Watch says it is not against all immigration and the government already publishes accurate figures.

The announcement followed the final meeting of the commission - which includes singer Bob Geldof - in London. As well as more aid, fairer trade and less debt, the commission is likely to demand action on corruption in Africa. Mr Blair told a news conference: \"It will be a report that's brutally frank about the reality, but I hope idealistic about what can be done if the will is there. \"It's an ambitious project we have set ourselves and you will have to judge on its outcome when we publish it.\"\n\nMr Blair has vowed to put Africa at the top of his agenda during his time at the helm of the G8. He acknowledged he would have a \"a job of persuading to do\" on other nations to get the necessary commitment to debt relief. Bob Geldof, in characteristically blunt style, promised that the commission would not just be a talking shop but would deliver radical new thinking to change direction for Africa. The former rock star's presence on the commission has been interpreted as a sign that it will be uncompromising in its demands.

         "Butler launches attack on Blair\n\nFormer civil service chief Lord Butler has criticised the way Tony Blair's government operates, accusing it of being obsessed with headlines.\n\nHe also attacked the way the Iraq war was \"sold\" to the public, with important warnings on the strength of the intelligence left out. Tory leader Michael Howard said Lord Butler had given the \"most damaging testimony\" he could remember. But Downing Street said Mr Blair should be judged by results not his style.\n\nLord Butler said Mr Blair bypassed the Cabinet and relied instead on small, informal groups of advisers to help him make decisions. The prime minister's official spokesman said the Cabinet was still used to achieve a consensus on important issues. But he added: \"You cannot, in a modern government, take every decision in Cabinet. It's just not possible.\"\n\nLord Butler said the government had too much freedom to \"bring in bad Bills\" and \"to do whatever it likes\" and it relied too much on the advice of political appointees. The former cabinet secretary said in an interview with The Spectator magazine: \"I would be critical of the present government in that there is too much emphasis on selling, there is too much central control and there is too little of what I would describe as reasoned deliberation which brings in all the arguments.\" Mr Howard described Lord Butler's intervention as \"very important\". \"This is from someone who was an insider at the very heart of the Blair government. \"It is certainly the most damaging testimony I can ever remember from someone in such an eminent position.\"\n\nLord Butler's report earlier this year into Iraq intelligence said the government's September 2002 weapons dossier did not make clear intelligence about claims that Saddam Hussein had stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons was \"very thin\". The reason for this is that it would have weakened ministers' case for war, Lord Butler said in his Spectator interview, which was conducted by the magazine's editor, Conservative MP Boris Johnson. He said: \"When civil servants give material to ministers, they say these are the conclusions we've drawn, but we've got to tell you the evidence we've got is pretty thin. \"Similarly, if you are giving something to the United Nations and the country you should warn them.\"\n\nAsked why he thought the warnings were not there Lord Butler said: \"One has got to remember what the purpose of the dossier was. The purpose of the dossier was to persuade the British why the government thought Iraq was a very serious threat.\"\n\nWhen asked whether he thought the country was well-governed on the whole, he replied: \"Well. I think we are a country where we suffer very badly from Parliament not having sufficient control over the executive, and that is a very grave flaw. \"We should be breaking away from the party whip. The executive is much too free to bring in a huge number of extremely bad Bills, a huge amount of regulation and to do whatever it likes - and whatever it likes is what will get the best headlines tomorrow. \"All that is part of what is bad government in this country.\" Lord Butler's assessment was backed by his predecessor as Cabinet Secretary, Lord Armstrong. Lord Armstrong told BBC Two's Newsnight: \"I agree ... there doesn't appear to be the sort of informed collective political judgement brought to bear on decision-making that those affected by decisions are entitled to expect.\" Liberal Democrat deputy leader Menzies Campbell said he thought Lord Butler's comments were \"well justified\" and Mr Blair's style of leadership was \"corrosive of the whole system of government\". But Labour former minister Jack Cunningham accused Lord Butler of basing his comments on the first eight months of the incoming Labour administration, when he was cabinet secretary. Mr Cunningham told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"Taken together, Robin Butler's comments are partial, inaccurate and cannot be taken as anything other than politically biased against the Labour government.\"\n",

         "Lib Dems demand new inquiry\n\nA judge should look into the David Blunkett controversy as key questions remain unanswered, the Lib Dems say.\n\nSir Alan Budd's inquiry linked the ex-home secretary to the speeding up of a visa claim by his ex-lover's nanny. But he could not say whether Mr Blunkett had treated the nanny as a special case or had used her as an example of immigration problems. Lib Dem spokesman Mark Oaten said the number of officials who had forgotten what happened was worrying. He told BBC News: \"I'm extremely concerned that 20 individuals appear to have forgotten what happened or more suspiciously are not prepared to say what happened. \"That must be bad for government, it must be bad for public confidence in the system.\"\n\nMr Oaten said people would be mystified why Sir Alan's inquiry failed to uncover why processing of the visa application was speeded up. He said: \"There is a strong case for a judge-led judicial review of this because, of course, next time it happens it may not be about a nanny and their visa. It may be about something even more important than that. \"So we do need to understand what took place and who was involved.\" The Tories criticised the Lib Dem stance, saying Mr Oaten had initially said he accepted Mr Blunkett's word unless further evidence emerged. But Lib Dem officials say Mr Oaten was speaking when an inquiry was under way and was avoiding rushing to judgement.\n",

         "UK set to cut back on embassies\n\nNine overseas embassies and high commissions will close in an effort to save money, UK Foreign Secretary Jack Straw has announced.\n\nThe Bahamas, East Timor, Madagascar and Swaziland are among the areas affected by the biggest shake-up for the diplomatic service for years. Other diplomatic posts are being turned over to local staff. Mr Straw said the move would save £6m a year to free up cash for priorities such as fighting terrorism.\n\nHonorary consuls will be appointed in some of the areas affected by the embassy closures. Nine consulates or consulates general will also be closed, mostly in Europe and America.\n\nThey include Dallas in the US, Bordeaux in France and Oporto in Portugal, with local staff replacing UK representation in another 11. The changes are due to be put in place before the end of 2006, with most savings made from cutting staff and running costs. Some of the money will have to be used to fund redundancy payments. In a written statement, Mr Straw said: \"The savings made will help to underpin higher priority work in line with the Foreign and Commonwealth Office's strategic priorities, including counter- proliferation, counter-terrorism, energy and climate change. \"Some of the savings will also be redeployed to strategic priority work within certain regions where we are closing posts. \"In Africa, for instance, we plan to create new jobs to cover these issues across the region, with a new post in Nairobi to help support our work on climate change, one in Nigeria to cover energy and one in Pretoria to cover regional issues more generally as well as covering Maseru and Mbabane.\"\n\nThe Foreign Office currently has about 6,100 UK-based staff. It has opened major new missions on Baghdad and Basra in Iraq, Kabul in Afghanistan and Pyongyang in North Korea since 1997 in response to what the government says are changing needs. Since 1997 10 overseas posts have been closed - excluding Wednesday's cuts - but 18 new embassies or consulates have been opened. The shake-up is aimed at helping making £86m in efficiency savings between 2005 and 2008. The chancellor has demanded all government departments make similar savings. Shadow foreign secretary Michael Ancram said there was a constant need to ensure value for money from foreign missions. \"But the government must give a far clearer reason for making the dramatic changes it has announced and must show that British commercial interests and the interests of Britons abroad will not be adversely affected,\" he said.\n",

         "Labour targets 'hardcore truants'\n\nA fresh crackdown on persistent truants in England has been launched by Education Secretary Ruth Kelly.\n\nSerial truants make up one in 13 pupils. Previous initiatives brought 40,000 pupils back to school since 1997, according to official statistics. Parenting contracts, penalty notices and \"fast track\" prosecution systems have been used to tackle what has been a stubborn problem. It is thought that nearly half a million children skip school each day. Tories say Labour's previous success regarding the issue came because it tackled the easy part of the problem by reducing authorised absence, where parents are permitted to take children out of school. Such absences are often due to family holidays.\n\nHowever, serial truants avoid the classroom despite government schemes costing £885m. Those missing classes are more likely to become involved in crime as well as failing academically. Measures such as parenting contracts and penalty notices were adopted by most local education authorities last term and come into force in the remainder this term. In one local education authority alone 800 parents were warned they would receive a penalty notice unless their child's attendance improved. The tough stance paid off with just 24 issued, while attendance improved in 776 cases. Truancy has been reduced by 5% at the 128 worst hit schools through the government's Behaviour Improvement Programme. This is the equivalent of 200 pupils back in classes since September.\n\nThe new measures come on top of national truancy sweeps - the sixth of which will take place on Monday. Police and education welfare officers patrol problem hotspots picking up truants and returning them to school. Held twice each year, in addition to routine local patrols, previous country-wide sweeps have apprehended 31,000 pupils dodging school. In almost 14,000 of those cases, the youngsters were accompanied by their parents. A Department for Education and Skills source said: \"Every day in school counts. \"It is clear form these figures that schools and local education authorities are now seizing the tools we have given them to improve school attendance and crack down hard on the very small numbers of pupils which account for almost half of the nation's truancy.\"\n",

         "Blunkett sorry over murder plan\n\nDavid Blunkett has apologised to MPs after the Home Office announced \"prematurely\" via press release a review of murder laws.\n\nThe home secretary confirmed the review was to get under way in the wake of a Law Commission report which branded the current murder law as \"a mess\". He said the review would look at partial defences to murder, including provocation and at mandatory sentences. The Home Office has already said the review will begin next year.\n\nOn Wednesday, a Home Office spokeswoman said the terms of reference for the review had not been established but it was likely to include only England and Wales. News of the review was released because it was thought Mr Blunkett would make the official announcement in a Commons debate on Wednesday. But the announcement never came, with the home secretary saying the debate had never reached that stage. Amid opposition anger, Mr Blunkett had to answer an emergency question in Parliament on Thursday. He said he had taken steps to ensure the incident was not repeated. Shadow home secretary David Davis welcomed his \"gracious apology\" and the review itself. But he argued the minister should have volunteered a formal statement instead of having to be \"dragged\" to face MPs.\n\nIn its report, the Law Commission said it had found wide support among criminal justice professionals for an end to the mandatory life sentence for murder. The panel suggested different kinds of murders could be \"graded\" to recognise the seriousness of the offence.\n\nBut the Home Office said mandatory life sentences would not be abolished and argued courts already had flexibility. The commission, an independent body including two judges, a senior barrister and sentencing experts, had been asked to consider reforms to the defence of provocation in murder cases. But it said its proposals were unlikely to work without a far wider review of the law. Results of a consultation exercise showed 64 respondents out of 146 - among them 21 judges - believed a mandatory life sentence for every murder was \"indefensible and should cease\".\n\nA key question was whether one category should continue to cover all types of murder from mercy killings to serial or contract killings. The commission found support for the idea of grading murders so that the sentence reflected the seriousness of the offence. But speaking after the report was published, Home Office minister Baroness Scotland said: \"Murder is the most serious of crimes and we have no intention of abolishing the mandatory life sentence. \"Where an offender is convicted of murder, the court must pass a life sentence.\" The commission also recommended tightening the law so that the provocation defence cannot be used in cases where someone has killed for revenge, such as a jealous husband who murders an unfaithful wife.\n",

         "Hunt demo at Labour meeting\n\nPro-hunt supporters are set to protest at Labour's spring conference.\n\nThe Countryside Alliance says it expects up to 4,000 supporters to demonstrate against the hunting ban. They have agreed to keep to a demonstration site on the other side of the River Tyne from the conference venue in Gateshead. A bid to overturn the law banning hunting with dogs in England and Wales has begun in the Court of Appeal. The ban comes into force on 18 February. The Court of Appeal is expected to rule early next week on whether the alliance's challenge has succeeded. Richard Dodd, regional director of the Countryside Alliance, said he expected between 2,000 and 4,000 supporters in Tyneside to make their protest, with hunt horns and placards.\n\nCampaigners have been asked not to bring any animals or alcohol.\n\nMr Dodd said he did not believe there would be any repeat of the trouble which marred the pro-hunt demonstration outside Parliament in September. \"We are holding a static demonstration, just to remind Labour that we are not going away,\" he said. Northumbria Police said the pedestrian Millennium Bridge, by the demonstration site, will be shut if necessary. But Assistant Chief Constable David Warcup has liaised with several protest groups and said all negotiations had gone well. Fathers 4 Justice, pensioners' rights activists and Stop the War campaigners were also expected to demonstrate during the three-day conference which starts on Friday. Pro-hunt campaigners claims the 1949 Parliament Act - which extends the right of the House of Commons to overrule the House of Lords - was itself invalid because it was never passed by peers. The High Court last month ruled the act was valid and the proposed hunting ban was lawful. Pro-hunt supporters formally launched their second legal challenge to the ban in London's High Court on Thursday. The Countryside Alliance has lodged papers seeking a judicial review on human rights grounds. Animal welfare groups have welcomed the ban, many of whom have campaigned for a ban for decades saying hunting is cruel and unnecessary.\n",

         "Protesters plan airport challenge\n\nCampaigners against the expansion of Britain's airports have begun challenging the government's plans in the High Court.\n\nBAA's expansion of Stansted Airport in Essex by building an extra runway is one of the most fiercely opposed plans. Opponents say the £2bn cost of the new runway could not be met unless cash from Heathrow and Gatwick was used. They said this is illegal under current rules and are trying to block the government from changing legislation. BAA are also owners of the airports at Heathrow and Gatwick. They have said they cannot raise the money needed for the Stansted upgrades from current landing charges. BAA also says it has attempted to involve communities in any future airport plans.\n\nGroups challenging the plans include Stop Stansted Expansion, Heathrow anti-noise campaigners HACAN Clearskies and the London boroughs of Hillingdon and Wandsworth. Their opponents are also likely to complain there was no public consultation before an extra runway was built at Luton Airport, or when it changed take-off and landing procedures at Heathrow. If the group wins, the government's future aviation plans outlined in last year's transport White Paper could be left in ruins.\n\nThe campaigners will say the government did not adequately consider the building of new airports, such as one planned for the Isle of Sheppey east of London. Lord Hanningfield, leader of Essex County Council, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"We are going to the High Court because we want a judge to rule there should be a proper inquiry. \"We want a judge to say there has been inadequate preparation, consultation and thought before the government came out with its Green Paper. \"Then there could be a proper debate nationally about where this extra capacity should go.\" He added: \"Politicians should not decide where runways should be.\" The Stansted expansion, apart from the building of the new runway, would also need to include new terminal buildings to deal with the projected 50m passengers who will use it every year.\n\nThe airport is the hub of many of the no-frills airlines operating in the UK. But BAA has said it has attempted to involve communities in any future airport plans. At Heathrow, Gatwick, Edinburgh and Glasgow airports, BAA launched a series of consultations on blight to properties from the proposed expansion in September 2004, which will close next week. BAA is also offering to buy noise-hit properties for an index-linked, unblighted price. At Heathrow, BAA said it was working closely with all interested parties to see how the strict environmental, air quality and noise targets for a third runway can be met. At Gatwick, the company has written to homes and business likely to be affected by any extra runway.\n",

         "Tories attack burglar 'U-turns'\n\nTory leader Michael Howard has accused Tony Blair of performing U-turns over rules on using force against burglars.\n\nThe government has ruled out amending the present law, which allows \"reasonable force\" in self defence. Mr Howard branded the decision unacceptable, saying: \"It is not householders who should be frightened, it's the burglars.\" Home Secretary Charles Clarke said ministers had kept to their pledge to review the law.\n\nMetropolitan Police Commissioner Sir John Stevens last month backed a Tory attempt to change the law so only householders using \"grossly disproportionate\" force could be prosecuted. The pressure prompted the prime minister to say the police and Crown Prosecution Service would be consulted as part of a review of the law. He told MPs: \"If we get the right response from those people, we will, of course, support a change in the law.\" Instead, the government has decided no change is needed but there will be a publicity campaign so people are clear they are entitled to defend themselves. On Thursday, Mr Howard told BBC Radio 4's Today programme Mr Blair had initially refused the law change, then had come round to the idea and was now backtracking again. He said: \"We've had three policy positions in three months and two U-turns. \"It's not surprising Gordon Brown told him: 'There's nothing you could say to me now that I could ever believe.'\"\n\nMr Howard said the \"grossly disproportionate\" test matched the hurdle ministers had introduced for civil cases where burglars where claimed compensation from householders. The issue entered the public spotlight when Norfolk farmer Tony Martin was jailed for shooting dead a 16-year-old burglar in 1999 as he ran away from the farm. But the home secretary said Mr Howard was wrong to say the law was biased in favour of burglars. The barrister who had represented Mr Martin had said the rules were \"weighted overwhelmingly\" in favour of the householder, said Mr Clarke. He said: \"The problem is there has not been enough understanding of it - that was the point Sir John Stevens was making and the prime minister was making.\" The new guidance would help ensure clarity on the issue, added Mr Clarke. The director of public prosecutions, Ken Macdonald, says only 11 householders or occupiers of business premises have been prosecuted in the last 15 years. Those cases included a warehouse manager who had waited for a burglar, tied him up, beat him and set him alight, he said. Tory MP Patrick Mercer's private member's bill to change the law received a first reading in Parliament on Wednesday and goes to a full debate next month.\n",

Mr Blair is an enthusiastic proponent of talks to bring Turkey within the recently-expanded EU. Italy and Germany also favour an early start to talks, but there is scepticism in France and elsewhere. Some are worried that Turkey's large and rapidly growing population and low average income might make integration into the EU difficult.\n\nSome are concerned that a change of government could lead to Turkey reneging on key human rights reforms it has recently enacted. And many in France would prefer Turkey to admit that World War I-era killing of Armenians constituted genocide. There are also issues in France and the Netherlands over the possible problems of integrating the first major Muslim nation into the EU. But Mr Blair and the Labour government have been the staunchest backers of Turkish accession, provided it sticks with human rights and economic reform. Mr Blair's official spokesman said: \"The prime minister has regular meetings with both of them and particularly in advance of European Councils. \"The key issue at this week's council will be that of Turkey, but they will also discuss a range of other matters.\"\n",

He said his party was the one of hope and was ready for a 2005 poll. On the Asian tsunami he said it had been \"very heartening\" to learn of the generosity being shown by Britons. Mr Kennedy said his thoughts were with all those caught up in the disaster, which had dominated the Christmas and New Year period. At home he said many people were turning to the Liberal Democrats as they became disheartened with the politics of the other two main parties.\n\nThe general election would be a three-party struggle, as the Conservative party \"fades away\" as a national force and the Liberal Democrats challenge Labour in its heartlands, he said. \"A clear division is emerging in British politics - the politics of fear versus the politics of hope. \"Labour is counting on the politics of fear, ratcheting up talk of threats, crime and insecurity. While the Conservatives are re-working their populist scares about asylum and the European 'menace',\" he said. He said the government was using this climate of fear to try to strip away civil liberties.\n\nIt was already using detention without trial at Belmarsh Prison, ignoring a recent Law Lords judgement that this contravenes basic human rights, he said. He also criticised attempts to bring in trial without jury, plans to lower the burden of proof in some criminal trials, curbing of rights to protest, increased stop and search powers and ID card plans. He said while everyone had the right to be secure they also had the right to be protected against unfair discrimination. \"But at the same time, an overmighty state is a dangerous one,\" he said. His party \"instinctively\" understood the \"new liberal Britain\" which is no longer a nation with one family structure, and one colour, he said. \"We are less deferential; more inclined to think for ourselves; more open about sexuality and equality. \"Our national institutions are changing too. We are no longer a nation of one church; we are a nation of many faiths. In our attitudes and the way we live our lives, this is in many ways a liberal Britain.\"\n",

Anne Borthwick, of Campaign for Borders Rail, said reopening the Waverley Line would restore the area's prosperity. MSPs are considering the reintroduction of passenger rail services through Midlothian to the Borders. Campaigners have said that reopening the Waverley Line, which could cost up to £100m, would be a huge economic boost for the Borders.\n\nIn 2000, Borders Council said the area's economy had suffered since the closure.

A study in 2000, which was commissioned by the executive, Scottish Borders Council, Midlothian Council and Scottish Borders Enterprise, found that a half-hourly service from Tweedbank to Edinburgh could cover its operating costs.

         "'Hitler' row over Welsh arts cash\n\nAn artist critical of Welsh arts funding being brought under assembly government control has denied comparing the idea with dictatorships in Russia and Germany.\n\nShani Rhys James is worried that the Arts Council of Wales may be taken over by the Welsh Assembly Government. Culture Minister Alun Pugh said it would be \"crass and ignorant\" to liken a quango review to Hitler's Germany. But Ms James emphasised she had actually said artists needed freedom. The future of the Arts Council of Wales has been in question since it was announced that most Welsh quangos would eventually be abolished.\n\nIt was announced last July that three Welsh quangos, education and training body Elwa, the Wales Tourist Board and the Welsh Development Agency, would be brought under assembly government control. The Arts Council of Wales may be among the next to come under the assembly government's umbrella. But Ms James, who won the £30,000 Jerwood painting prize in 2003, said arts funding should be separate from government. Ms James told BBC Radio Wales: \"It's quite dangerous when you involve politicians because it's not like the health service and it's not like the railways. \"Free expression is absolutely vital in a democratic society. You need distance, you do not need government interference because it could be taken the wrong way.\"\n\nBut she said reports that she had likened the assembly government to totalitarian regimes were inaccurate.\n\nShe told Good Morning Wales: \"Just to put the record straight, that business in the paper where it said I likened the government to Bolshevik Russia or Hitler's Germany, the actual quote I gave was: 'It is vital to a civilised society that we allow artists to express themselves without government control'. \"As we know from past European history, i.e. Russia and Germany in the early 20th Century, artists will go underground or leave the country or rather than compromise their expression'. \"Artists need a free voice to express themselves - they reflect a truth through their own art forms.'\" She said the assembly government was not best placed to run the arts in Wales.\n\nShe added: \"It would be a momentous change and devastating to the arts. It would set the arts scene back 60 years, because I really don't think the government has the expertise. \"If you have the National Assembly taking control, I fear you are going to be going back to the dragons and leeks and the choirs.\n\n\"Wales has moved on. It is international now. It is not set back in How Green Was My Valley?\" Responding to Ms James' criticisms, Mr Pugh said: \"The structure of unelected quangos is under review and we have made it clear that further announcements are due shortly. \"Comparing the Welsh Assembly Government to Hitler's Germany is a crass and ignorant response to a real issue about democratic accountability.\" Ms James, whose father was Welsh, was born in Melbourne where her parents worked in the theatre. She moved to Powys nearly 20 years ago where she works from her studio near Llangadfan. She has won a number of arts prizes including the Wales Open in 1989 and the Mostyn Open in 1991.\n",

         "Lords wrong on detainees - Straw\n\nJack Straw has attacked the decision by Britain's highest court that detaining foreign terrorist suspects without trial breaks human rights laws.\n\nThe foreign secretary said the right to life was the \"most important liberty\" and the government had a duty to protect people from terrorism. Law lords were \"simply wrong\" to imply the men were being held arbitrarily. New Home Secretary Charles Clarke vowed the nine men would remain in prison while the law was being reviewed.\n\nThe House of Lords ruled by an eight to one majority in favour of appeals by the men - dealing a major blow to the government's anti-terror policy.\n\nBut Mr Straw denied it amounted to a \"constitutional crisis\". He said those held had a right of appeal to the special immigration appeal tribunal and the decision to hold the suspects was upheld by that court. \"The law lords are simply wrong to imply that this is a decision to detain these people on the whim or the certificate of the home secretary,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. The foreign secretary insisted it was for Parliament, and not judges, to decide how best Britain could be defended against the threat of terrorism. But Liberal Democrat peer Lord Carlile, the government's independent reviewer of anti-terrorism laws, said it was possible some of the detainees could now be released. He said the Law Lords' ruling was an \"embarrassment\" for the government and major changes were needed to the law.\n\nThe ruling came on Charles Clarke's first day as home secretary following David Blunkett's resignation. In a statement to MPs, Mr Clarke said: \"I will be asking Parliament to renew this legislation in the New Year.\n\n\"In the meantime, we will be studying the judgment carefully to see whether it is possible to modify our legislation to address the concerns raised by the House of Lords.\" The detainees took their case to the House of Lords after the Court of Appeal backed the Home Office's powers to hold them without limit or charge. The government opted out of part of the European Convention on Human Rights concerning the right to a fair trial in order to bring in anti-terrorism legislation in response to the 11 September attacks in the US. Any foreign national suspected of links with terrorism can be detained or can opt to be deported. But those detained cannot be deported if this would mean persecution in their homeland. On Thursday, Lord Bingham - a senior law lord - said the rules were incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights as they allowed detentions \"in a way that discriminates on the ground of nationality or immigration status\" by justifying detention without trial for foreign suspects, but not Britons. Lord Nicholls of Birkenhead, in his ruling, said: \"Indefinite imprisonment without charge or trial is anathema in any country which observes the rule of law.\n\nIn a statement, detainee 'A' in Woodhill Prison said: \"I hope now that the government will act upon this decision, scrap this illegal 'law' and release me and the other internees to return to our families and loved ones.\" The case was heard by a panel of nine law lords rather than the usual five because of the constitutional importance of the case. Solicitor Gareth Pierce, who represents eight of the detainees, claimed the detention had driven four of the detainees to \"madness\", saying two were being held in Broadmoor hospital.\n",

         "Profile: David Blunkett\n\nBefore he resigned the position of home secretary on Wednesday, David Blunkett had been in charge of a substantial body of government portfolios including race, policing and immigration.\n\nHis responsibilities in running the Home Office included civil emergencies, security, terrorism and expenditure. Named home secretary after the 2001 general election, Mr Blunkett had seen the focus on his office intensify. The attacks on the World Trade Center on 11 September 2001 heightened concern for security and immigration in particular. A Labour loyalist from a working class background Mr Blunkett, 57, had been unafraid of pushing for tough changes to Labour policy.\n\nRecently the issue of identity cards had provoked controversy with questions raised over cost and invasions of civil liberties. Mr Blunkett was also at the centre of a humiliating scandal involving the former immigration minister Beverly Hughes. Having received his full backing, Ms Hughes was forced to resign in April over abuses in the visa processing system, which she claimed to be unaware of. Mr Blunkett's own comments on immigration had prompted censure - he told refugees from Afghanistan and Kosovo to \"get back home\" to start rebuilding their countries. And he also urged people from ethnic minorities to develop a \"sense of belonging\" in Britain, telling them to speak English at home. Avoiding political correctness is second nature to the former home secretary, who spurns a metropolitan elite and \"airy fairy libertarians\" and earlier in the year coined the phrase \"liberati\", as an amalgam of \"glitterati\" and \"liberal\". Yet in January of this year he courted further controversy over his seemingly liberal reclassification of cannabis, from a Grade B to Grade C status drug .\n\nBefore the recent furore, Mr Blunkett had always appeared more interested in politics than his personal life. Mr Blunkett told the Daily Telegraph in 2001 that he continued to wear his wedding ring, in spite of being a divorcee, as \"a useful way of ensuring that people don't casually think I am available\". He added: \"I am not available because I am just getting on with the job.\" Mr Blunkett entered Parliament for Sheffield Brightside in 1987, after first contesting the Sheffield Hallam seat in 1974. He is one of very few blind MPs, and was the first to reach the front bench and the Cabinet. His relaxed performances - with his guide dog by his side - at the despatch box, in the Labour Party's National Executive, and on the conference platform made it easy to forget his disability. Mr Blunkett himself described not being able to see as simply \"an inconvenience\". Using Braille for speeches, and briefed by his officials on tape, he also has a sharp tongue at times, and a pragmatic approach to politics.\n\nMr Blunkett was schooled in Sheffield where he led the city council for seven years before entering the Commons. He chaired the Labour Party nationally, and was a unifying force in the 80s and 90s, shadowing health and education. In Tony Blair's first government Mr Blunkett was put in charge of education and employment, where he won big increases in funds for schools, while insisting on improved standards of literacy and numeracy. He was prepared to stand up to the teaching unions - which sometimes heckled his speeches - and his policy of charging university students for tuition fees was not popular. In the Labour Party he has been regarded as a loyal colleague, a conciliator who avoids factions, and a man whose humour and determination make him widely popular. There have been wry smiles as well. In 1999, his then guide dog Lucy threw up in the Chamber during the speech of his Tory opponent. Lucy was replaced by her half-sister, Sadie, a black Labrador-curly-coated retriever cross, in 2003 after nearly a decade by Mr Blunkett's side.\n",

         "Strike threat over pension plans\n\nMillions of public service workers could strike if ministers scrap their final salary pension scheme and make them work longer, warn union leaders.\n\nThe Cabinet Office has confirmed it is reviewing the current pension system, prompting unions representing 4.5m workers to threaten united action. They believe the plans include raising the mandatory retirement age for public service workers from 60 to 65. The government says unions will be consulted before any changes are made.\n\nIt is thought the proposed overhaul, due on Thursday, could mean pensions could be based on a \"career average\" salary. For each year served, staff currently get one eightieth of their highest salary in the final three years. Ministers will be anxious to avoid mass strike action in the lead-up to the next general election, which is widely expected next May. In a statement on Sunday, the Cabinet Office said it was reviewing the Civil Service Pension Scheme, and hoped to announce proposals soon. \"Unions will of course be consulted about any proposed changes. \"Public sector pension schemes need to remain affordable and sustainable. People are living longer and pensions are getting more expensive. \"To maintain the long-term affordability of our pension scheme, the government announced in its Green Paper on pensions that pension age would rise from 60 to 65.\" On Monday, Tony Blair's official spokesman declined to say whether the prime minister backed the plans. He said: \"What's important is that there's a process going on, it's out for consultation at the moment, let's wait for that process to complete itself.\"\n\nThere is already widespread anger over the chancellor's plans to get rid of more than 100,000 civil servants. Now public service unions are united against the plans and the Trades Union Congress is discussing the issue next Monday. Dave Prentis, general secretary of Unison, said changes to pension provisions for workers in the public sector would mean they had to pay in more but would still face a raw deal. \"Members working in the NHS or for local government have never had high pay or city bonuses, but they could look forward to a decent pension - now all that is being taken away,\" he said. \"What really riles me is the breathtaking hypocrisy of MPs who recently voted themselves the best pension scheme in Europe, but say they can't afford it for anyone else. \"This is a position that Unison cannot accept and will oppose. It will lead to conflict between Unison and the government, if not this year then next.\"\n\nMr Prentis said workers did not want to go on strike and called for talks between unions and the highest level of government. Mark Serwotka, from the Public and Commercial Services union said there should be a co-ordinated one day strike unless there was a government rethink. The Fire Brigades Union said the government was planning to cut ill health retirement benefits for firefighters and other measures to chip away at pensions. Pensions officer Paul Woolstenholmes said: \"The pensions of millions of public sector workers are under threat - apart from MPs and judges who have the most generous pensions arrangements in the country.\"\n",

         "Parties warned over 'grey vote'\n\nPolitical parties cannot afford to take older UK voters for granted in the coming election, says Age Concern.\n\nA survey for the charity suggests 69% of over-55s say they always vote in a general election compared with just 17% of 18 to 24 year olds. Charity boss Gordon Lishman said if a \"decisive blow\" was struck at the election it would be by older voters who could be relied on to turn out. A total of 3,028 adults aged 18 or over were interviewed for the study. Mr Lishman urged the next government to boost state pension.\n\nHe also called for measures to combat ageism and build effective public services to \"support us all in an ageing society\". \"Older people want to see manifesto commitments that will make a difference to their lives,\" Mr Lishman said. \"Political parties must wake up to the fact that unless they address the demands and concerns of older people they will not keep or attract their vote.\" In the survey carried out by ICM Research, 14% of people aged between 18 and 34 said they never voted in general elections. Among the over-65s, 70% said they would be certain to vote in an immediate election, compared with 39% of people under 55. Age Concern says the over-55s are \"united around\" key areas of policy they want the government to focus on. For 57%, pensions and the NHS were key issues, while the economy was important for a third, and tax was a crucial area for 25%.\n",

It has been reported they could be questioned about Prince Charles' spending on Camilla Parker Bowles. But BBC correspondent Peter Hunt said they are not responsible for how money is spent and may be unable to answer. Duchy officials, who will appear before the committee on Monday, are only responsible for generating money. The Duchy of Lancaster provides the Queen's private income, while the Duchy of Cornwall provides Prince Charles' annual income. The Duchy of Cornwall is a 140,000-acre estate across 25 counties, and also includes residential properties, shops, offices, stocks and shares. It was set up in 1337 by King Edward III to provide income for successive heirs to the throne. It covers the cost of the prince's public and private life - neither Charles, nor William and Harry, receive taxpayers' money from the Civil List. However, the Prince of Wales did receive over £4m from government departments and grants-in-aid in 2003-4. The duchy last year generated almost £12m. The prince has voluntarily paid income tax - currently 40% - since 1993.\n",

         "Tory leader 'cleared' over work\n\nScottish Conservative Party leader David McLetchie claims he has been cleared over a potential conflict of interest.\n\nThe Edinburgh MSP earns up to £30,000 a year from the law firm Tods Murray, where he is a partner. Mr McLetchie said he has taken advice from Holyrood officials about what details he needs to declare. He was advised to exercise judgement to avoid the perception of a conflict and said he had done nothing wrong. As an MSP, Mr McLetchie signed a parliamentary motion questioning expansion plans for Edinburgh Airport.\n\nIt then emerged Tods Murray has a client which opposes the development. Mr McLetchie then sought guidance from the standards committee to clarify his position. BBC Scotland's political correspondent Glenn Campbell said no complaint had been made against Mr McLetchie, but questions were raised about his dual role. Glenn said MSPs are advised to guard against a conflict of interests and a perception of a conflict.\n\nMr McLetchie said: \"I'm quite clear that no conflicts of interest arise in my case, that the judgement I took has effectively been vindicated when you look at the advice that has been given to me and that these allegations are unfounded.\" He said nothing had changed in respect of his work with the law firm and it was a matter he would have to discuss with the other partners at Tods Murray. \"The firm and I have a very good working relationship and we have done for the last six years,\" said Mr McLetchie. \"I don't suppose I'll be working forever as a lawyer or a politician. I deserve to retire from both, but I'm not willing to put time limits on them.\"\n",

         "Blair and Blunkett Sheffield trip\n\nTony Blair is to join Home Secretary David Blunkett in a visit to Sheffield on Thursday.\n\nMr Blunkett's conduct is being looked at to establish whether he abused his position in relation to his ex-lover. The Parliamentary standards watchdog is looking at his decision to give Kimberly Quinn free rail tickets. He is also being investigated over the visa application of Mrs Quinn's ex-nanny. The visit to Sheffield will be seen as a show of unity by Mr Blair.\n\nOn Wednesday during Prime Minister's Questions, Tory leader Michael Howard went on the offensive over comments Mr Blunkett is alleged to have made in a new biography. He is understood to have made a series of criticisms about his Cabinet colleagues from the prime minister down. Mr Howard said Mr Blunkett had complained he had inherited a \"giant mess\" when he took over at the Home Office from Jack Straw, now foreign secretary. The Tory leader went on: \"He doesn't stop there: he thinks the culture secretary's weak; he thinks the trade secretary doesn't think strategically and he thinks the education secretary hasn't developed as expected. \"He says the prime minister doesn't like being told the truth and the chancellor - no doubt the prime minister will agree with this - is a bully.\" Mr Blair retorted voters remembered the record of a government and no comments by politicians.\n\nThe home secretary has already admitted he was wrong to give the two first class tickets, given to him as an MP, to Mrs Quinn and has since paid the £180 back. He has apologised for \"a genuine mistake\" and says he will write to the watchdog to answer further questions. The rail tickets are meant to help MPs' spouses get between Westminster and their constituencies. After his inquiry, Parliamentary watchdog Sir Philip Mawer will report to the Commons Standards and Privileges Committee, the group of MPs who will recommend to the full House of Commons what action - if any - should be taken against Mr Blunkett.\n\nThe separate inquiry by ex-senior civil servant Sir Alan Budd is investigating whether the home secretary helped fast-track a bid by Mrs Quinn's nanny, Leoncia Casalme, to stay in the UK. Last week, Mr Blunkett won the first round of a High Court battle with Mrs Quinn for access to her son. Mr Blunkett declined to comment about his own position, saying the inquiry was under way and the High Court had stressed his right to privacy did not affect his job in improving security and stability. Downing Street has stressed Mr Blair's support for the home secretary.\n",

         "Student 'fee factor' played down\n\nA rise has been recorded in the number of students from south of the border applying to universities in Scotland.\n\nHowever, Lifelong Learning Minister Jim Wallace said that this would not result in Scottish students missing out. Applications from England and Wales rose by 17% between January 2005 and the previous year, up 23,600 to 27,700. Fears had been expressed that a flood of \"fee refugees\" would try to avoid top-up fees of up to £3,000 a year being introduced in England. In June last year, Mr Wallace announced proposals to increase tuition fees for English students studying in Scotland by £2,000 in an attempt to prevent a cross-border flood, although no figure has yet been agreed. Legislation to introduce the top-up fees in England is not due to take effect until autumn 2006 and students who start before then will not have to pay additional fees at all.\n\nThe figures were made public on Thursday by admissions service Ucas. Universities Scotland, which represents university principals, claimed that an increase in applications did not amount to Scottish students being squeezed out. Director, David Caldwell, said some students could be applying in an attempt to avoid the possible increase in annual fees at English universities, but this was not a major factor. He told BBC Radio Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme: \"The reason people are opting for Scottish universities is that they are perceived as being of very high quality, they offer very attractive courses and Scotland is seen as a very attractive place to study.\n\n\"They know that when they take up their studies in 2006 they will be hit by top-up fees if they are going to a university in England and that may be part of the reason why the numbers coming to Scotland are so inflated. \"However, it does not mean that we will see thousands of additional students from England studying here.\" Mr Wallace agreed and said the figures had to be looked at in context. He explained that when applications were translated into acceptances, the number was not huge - an additional figure of about 200.\n\nAlso, the picture was further blurred by the fact that applications from Wales, where there are no plans for top-up fees, have also risen, by 19%. Mr Wallace said: \"Accepting students from all parts of the world does show the high regard in which Scottish higher education is held, not just in Britain. \"We want to make sure that when students are making their choice, they do so on the nature of the course and not because they are under some sort of financial pressure to go to Scotland. \"We do not want to have a situation where it becomes impossible for Scottish students to get places at Scottish universities because we are seen as the cheap option. \"Very often the quality of the university experience is enhanced by the fact there are students coming from a wide range of backgrounds so it would be wrong to go the other way and start excluding students.\"\n",

         "Anglers 'could face prosecution'\n\nAnglers and fishermen could find themselves prosecuted under plans to crack down on animal cruelty, a committee of MPs has warned.\n\nSloppy wording of the draft animal welfare bill could leave anglers facing court even though it was not intended, the environment select committee said. The MPs said they were \"concerned\" the government had not consulted directly on its plans to improve animal welfare. They raised complex and emotive issues which needed to be resolved, MPs said.\n\nThey called for a \"cast-iron guarantee\" that the government consults on any plans to regulate animal industries like pet fairs and game bird rearing. The draft bill seeks to modernise and improve animal welfare legislation, and intends to protect \"kept animals\" and \"companion\" animals by setting up a \"duty of care\". In addition to maintaining existing cruelty offences, it creates an offence of neglect by keepers who fail to protect the animals for whom they are responsible. The bill would allow animal welfare officers to intervene to prevent harm to an animal as well as outlawing \"mutilation\" of animals - unless it can be demonstrated to be in the animal's best interest.\n\nThe environment select committee made 101 recommendations after hearing evidence from 51 organisations and individuals. One was a call to amend the bill so that prosecutions against those engaged in fishing were not inadvertently encouraged - even if they were to later fail. \"We accept that neither commercial fishing nor recreational angling should fall within the remit of the of the draft bill and we therefore support the government's intention to exempt fishing as an activity.\"\n\nBut the committee said an amendment was needed to ensure cases were not brought. \"However, in exempting fishing, the government should be careful to ensure that those persons who catch fish are not given 'carte blanche' to inflict unnecessary suffering in the course of pursuing this activity,\" the committee added. The committee also said some legal protections for animals were downgraded by the bill, such as the law on abandonment of animals which \"would be significantly weakened\". MPs urged the government to redraft clauses relating to the prosecution of cruelty offences. This was because as it stood the draft bill would allow certain acts that should be prosecuted - such as unnecessary suffering caused to an animal through neglect, or unnecessary mental suffering - to go unpunished.\n\nCommittee chairman Michael Jack said: \"Any change in the law as it affects animals always arouses powerful emotions and great public interest. \"This draft bill is no exception. My committee welcomes the development of an approach to animal welfare which doesn't just wait for a problem to occur but enables action to be taken to protect animals before irreversible suffering takes place.\" But Mr Jack said the bill \"very much had the feel of a 'work in progress', and urged the government to guarantee that \"an obligation to consult will be enshrined in law\" before it extended legislative plans to areas such as pet fairs, circuses and game bird farms. \"The government must work hard to take the rough edges of its initial proposals before the bill is introduced to Parliament,\" he added.\n",

         "Clarke to press on with ID cards\n\nNew Home Secretary Charles Clarke has vowed to plough on with plans for ID cards despite a call for him to \"pause for thought\" from Charles Kennedy.\n\nThe Lib Dem leader said David Blunkett's resignation was a \"good opportunity\" to question whether the legislation was necessary. But Mr Clarke said he had supported the plans when Mr Blunkett argued for them in Cabinet and he supported them now. \"ID cards are a means to creating a more secure society,\" he said. Mr Clarke acknowledged how the measure was introduced remained a matter for debate but he said legislation had already been \"significantly influenced\" by the recommendations of the Commons' home affairs committee.\n\nThe issue would be debated in Parliament next Monday as scheduled he insisted. Earlier Mr Kennedy, whose party opposes the ID cards plan as \"deeply flawed\" said with Christmas coming up the new home secretary had time to think again. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that Mr Clarke had been reported to be less enthusiastic about ID cards than his predecessors. \"Wouldn't this be a good opportunity for a new home secretary, a new broom, to sweep clean in this respect and why do we need this legislation in the first place?\" he asked. Earlier this week the Tories announced they would back the government's plans although Michael Howard was forced to deny the shadow cabinet was split over its decision.\n\nThey had decided to support the plans as the police said they would help fight terror, crime and illegal immigration. Among those reported to have serious reservations over the strategy were senior shadow cabinet members David Davis, Oliver Letwin and Tim Yeo. The chairman of the Bar Council, Guy Mansfield QC has warned there is a real risk that people on the \"margins of society\" would be driven into the hands of extremists. \"What is going to happen to young Asian men when there has been a bomb gone off somewhere? They are going to be stopped. If they haven't [ID cards] they are going to be detained.\"\n\nThe Home Office says people will pay £85 for a passport and ID card together or a undecided fee for a separate ID card. The first cards would be issued in 2008 and when he was introducing the bill, Mr Blunkett suggested Parliament could decide in 2011 or 2012 whether to make it compulsory for everybody to own the cards, although not to carry them. The new bill will also create new criminal offences on the possession of false identity documents. And there will be civil penalties including a fine of up to £1,000 fine for people who fail to say they have moved house or changed other details and of up to £2,500 for failing to sign up if the cards become compulsory. The scheme will be overseen by a new independent watchdog.\n",

         "Scots smoking ban details set out\n\nSmoke-free areas will save lives and improve Scotland's health, First Minister Jack McConnell has insisted.\n\nHe told the Scottish Parliament on Wednesday that a \"comprehensive ban\" on smoking in public places would be introduced by the spring of 2006. Mr McConnell said the country's health rates were \"lamentable\" not least because of smoking. He said fines of up to £2,500 would be levied on employers and licences would be removed for non-compliance. Earlier, the Scottish Executive considered a range of options but agreed unanimously to introduce an all-out ban on smoking in public places. In a statement to parliament, Mr McConnell said that the licensed trade would be asked to join an expert committee prior to the ban coming into force.\n\nThe health arguments far outweighed lingering public disquiet about a complete ban and claims by the licensed trade that jobs would be lost, he told MSPs. He said there would be an international marketing campaign whereby \"tourists can enjoy smoke free environment and the sick man of Europe image becomes a thing of the past\". \"There are still national habits which hold us back - the time has come for this parliament to accelerate improvements in health,\" he declared. \"Health rates are lamentable because of a lack of exercise, drugs abuse, excessive drinking and over-eating. \"They all make us one of the most unhealthy countries in Europe, and too many smoke. \"It is clear that Scotland must not be held back by poor public health - the single biggest contribution devolved government can make is to reduce the toll of preventable death caused by smoking.\" The legislation will be introduced as part of the Health Service (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, which will be considered by parliament before Christmas. Main points of the plan:\n\n\n - A comprehensive ban on smoking in all enclosed public places in Scotland \n - The legislation will be enforced by environmental health and local licensing officers \n - Licensees or employers who fail to enforce the law will face fines up to a maximum of £2,500 \n - Licensees who persistently refuse to comply with the law will face the ultimate sanction of losing their liquor licence \n - A system of issuing fixed penalty notices for those individuals who break the law will be examined \n - Individuals who persistently break the law will face a maximum fine of £1,000. \n \n\nMr McConnell claimed there was evidence that smoking bans had helped smokers to either give up quicker or smoke less. He said there had been falling cigarette sales of 13% in New York and 16% in Ireland. Mr McConnell added that there had been a near nine per cent rise in tax revenues from New York bars and restaurants and, in Ireland, only a one point three per cent volume sales fall, where they were declining before the ban. The afternoon announcement, following a cabinet meeting on Wednesday morning, won broad support from opposition parties.\n\nThe Scottish National Party's Holyrood leader, Nicola Sturgeon, welcomed the move but added that the public should be consulted as the clock ticked towards the ban date. She said: \"The time has come for a ban on smoking in public places. \"There is evidence a ban can cut deaths from passive smoking and makes it easier for the 70% of smokers who desperately want to give up the habit. \"But we must also recognise that some people have concerns and reservations - there are people who are yet to be persuaded.\" The Scottish Conservative Party leader, David McLetchie, questioned what would be exempted from the ban. He was keen to know if inmates in Scottish prisons would continue to be allowed to smoke. Mr McLetchie asked: \"Would it not be ironic and perhaps entirely typical of the first minister's brave new Scotland that the criminals can be smokers but the smokers will become criminals?\" The Scottish Green Party's health spokeswoman, Eleanor Scott, said she was pleased Scotland would be following the \"success stories of New York and Ireland\". She believed the majority of people in Scotland wanted to go out without having to breathe in harmful tobacco smoke.\n",

       "      <td>Labour plans maternity pay rise\\n\\nMaternity pay for new mothers is to rise by £1,400 as part of new proposals announced by the Trade and Industry Secretary Patricia Hewitt.\\n\\nIt would mean paid leave would be increased to nine months by 2007, Ms Hewitt told GMTV's Sunday programme. Other plans include letting maternity pay be given to fathers and extending rights to parents of older children. The Tories dismissed the maternity pay plan as \"desperate\", while the Liberal Democrats said it was misdirected.\\n\\nMs Hewitt said: \"We have already doubled the length of maternity pay, it was 13 weeks when we were elected, we have already taken it up to 26 weeks. \"We are going to extend the pay to nine months by 2007 and the aim is to get it right up to the full 12 months by the end of the next Parliament.\" She said new mothers were already entitled to 12 months leave, but that many women could not take it as only six of those months were paid. \"We have made a firm commitment. We will definitely extend the maternity pay, from the six months where it now is to nine months, that's the extra £1,400.\" She said ministers would consult on other proposals that could see fathers being allowed to take some of their partner's maternity pay or leave period, or extending the rights of flexible working to carers or parents of older children. The Shadow Secretary of State for the Family, Theresa May, said: \"These plans were announced by Gordon Brown in his pre-budget review in December and Tony Blair is now recycling it in his desperate bid to win back women voters.\"\\n\\nShe said the Conservatives would announce their proposals closer to the General Election. Liberal Democrat spokeswoman for women Sandra Gidley said: \"While mothers would welcome any extra maternity pay the Liberal Democrats feel this money is being misdirected.\" She said her party would boost maternity pay in the first six months to allow more women to stay at home in that time.\\n\\nMs Hewitt also stressed the plans would be paid for by taxpayers, not employers. But David Frost, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, warned that many small firms could be \"crippled\" by the move. \"While the majority of any salary costs may be covered by the government's statutory pay, recruitment costs, advertising costs, retraining costs and the strain on the company will not be,\" he said. Further details of the government's plans will be outlined on Monday. New mothers are currently entitled to 90% of average earnings for the first six weeks after giving birth, followed by £102.80 a week until the baby is six months old.\\n</td>\n",

Government guidance said e-mails should only be deleted if they served \"no current purpose\", Mr Thomas said. The Tories and the Lib Dems have questioned the timing of the new rules.\\n\\nTory leader Michael Howard has written to Tony Blair demanding an explanation of the new rules on e-mail retention. On Monday Lib Dem constitutional affairs committee chairman Alan Beith warned that the deletion of millions of government e-mails could harm the ability of key probes like the Hutton Inquiry. The timing of the new rules just before the Freedom of Information Act comes into forces was \"too unlikely to have been a coincidence\", Mr Beith said. But a Cabinet Office spokeswoman said the move was not about the new laws or \"the destruction of important records\". Mr Beith urged the information commissioner to look at how the \"e-mail regime\" could \"support the freedom of information regime\".\\n\\nMr Thomas said: \"The new Act of Parliament makes it very clear that to destroy records in order to prevent their disclosure becomes a criminal offence.\" He said there was already clear guidance on the retention of e-mails contained in a code of practice from the lord chancellor. All e-mails are subject to the freedom of information laws, but the important thing was the content of the e-mail, said Mr Thomas.\\n\\n\"If in doubt retain, that has been the long-standing principle of the civil service and public authorities. It's only when you've got no further use for the particular record that it may be legitimate to destroy it. \"But any deliberate destruction to avoid the possibility of later disclosure is to be totally condemned.\" The Freedom of Information Act will cover England, Wales and Northern Ireland from next year. Similar measures are being brought in at the same time in Scotland. It provides the public with a right of access to information held by about 100,000 public bodies, subject to various exemptions. Its implementation will be monitored by the information commissioner.\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>Hewitt decries 'career sexism'\\n\\nPlans to extend paid maternity leave beyond six months should be prominent in Labour's election manifesto, the Trade and Industry Secretary has said.\\n\\nPatricia Hewitt said the cost of the proposals was being evaluated, but it was an \"increasingly high priority\" and a \"shared goal across government\". Ms Hewitt was speaking at a gender and productivity seminar organised by the Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC). Mothers can currently take up to six months' paid leave - and six unpaid. Ms Hewitt told the seminar: \"Clearly, one of the things we need to do in the future is to extend the period of payment for maternity leave beyond the first six months into the second six months. \"We are looking at how quickly we can do that, because obviously there are cost implications because the taxpayer reimburses the employers for the cost of that.\"\\n\\nMs Hewitt also announced a new drive to help women who want to work in male dominated sectors, saying sexism at work was still preventing women reaching their full potential. Plans include funding for universities to help female science and engineering graduates find jobs and \"taster courses\" for men and women in non-traditional jobs. Women in full-time work earn 19% less than men, according to the Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC).\\n\\nThe minister told delegates that getting rid of \"career sexism\" was vital to closing the gender pay gap.\\n\\n\"Career sexism limits opportunities for women of all ages and prevents them from achieving their full potential. \"It is simply wrong to assume someone cannot do a job on the grounds of their sex,\" she said. Earlier, she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"What we are talking about here is the fact that about six out of 20 women work in jobs that are low-paid and typically dominated by women, so we have got very segregated employment. \"Unfortunately, in some cases, this reflects very old-fashioned and stereotypical ideas about the appropriate jobs for women, or indeed for men. \"Career sexism is about saying that engineering, for instance, where only 10% of employees are women, is really a male-dominated industry. Construction is even worse. \"But it is also about saying childcare jobs are really there for women and not suitable for men. Career sexism goes both ways.\"\\n\\nShe added that while progress had been made, there was still a gap in pay figures. \"The average woman working full-time is being paid about 80p for every pound a man is earning. For women working part-time it is 60p.\" The Department for Trade and Industry will also provide funding to help a new pay experts panel run by the TUC.\\n\\nIt has been set up to advise hundreds of companies on equal wage policies. Research conducted by the EOC last year revealed that many Britons believe the pay gap between men and women is the result of \"natural differences\" between the sexes. Women hold less than 10% of the top positions in FTSE 100 companies, the police, the judiciary and trade unions, according to their figures. And retired women have just over half the income of their male counterparts on average.\\n</td>\n",

It will be the first time since 1917 that the party has chosen Manchester to host the annual event. Blackpool will get the much smaller February spring conference instead in what will be seen as a placatory move.\\n\\nFor years the main political parties have rotated between Blackpool, Bournemouth and Brighton. And the news the much larger annual conference is not to gather in Blackpool will be seen as a blow in the coastal resort. In 1998 the party said it would not return to Blackpool but did so in 2002. The following year Bournemouth hosted the event before the party signed a two year deal for Brighton to host the autumn conference.\\n\\nColin Asplin, Blackpool Hotel Association said: \"We have tried very hard to make sure they come back to Blackpool. \"Obviously we have failed in that. I just hope Manchester can handle the crowds. \"It amazes me that the Labour Party, which is a working class party, doesn't want to come to the main working class resort in the country.\" The exact cost to Blackpool in terms of lost revenue for hotel accommodation is not yet known but it is thought that block bookings will be taken at the major Manchester hotels after the official announcement.\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>Brown ally rejects Budget spree\\n\\nChancellor Gordon Brown's closest ally has denied suggestions there will be a Budget giveaway on 16 March.\\n\\nEd Balls, ex-chief economic adviser to the Treasury, said there would be no spending spree before polling day. But Mr Balls, a prospective Labour MP, said he was confident the chancellor would meet his fiscal rules. He was speaking as Sir Digby Jones, CBI director general, warned Mr Brown not to be tempted to use any extra cash on pre-election bribes.\\n\\nMr Balls, who stepped down from his Treasury post to stand as a Labour candidate in the election, had suggested that Mr Brown would meet his golden economic rule - \"with a margin to spare\". He said he hoped more would be done to build on current tax credit rules.\\n\\nHe also stressed rise in interest rates ahead of an expected May election would not affect the Labour Party's chances of winning. Expectations of a rate rise have gathered pace after figures showed house prices are still rising. Consumer borrowing rose at a near-record pace in January. \"If the MPC (the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee) were to judge that a rate rise was justified before the election because of the strength of the economy - and I'm not predicting that they will - I do not believe that this will be a big election issue in Britain for Labour,\" he told a Parliamentary lunch. \"This is a big change in our political culture.\"\\n\\nDuring an interview with BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Balls said he was sure Mr Brown's Budget would not put at risk the stability of the economy. \"I don't think we'll see a pre-election spending spree - we certainly did not see that before 2001,\" he said.\\n\\nHis assurances came after Sir Digby Jones said stability was all important and any extra cash should be spent on improving workers' skills. His message to the chancellor was: \"Please don't give it away in any form of electioneering.\" Sir Digby added: \"I don't think he will. I have to say he has been a prudent chancellor right the way through. Stability is the key word - British business needs boring stability more than anything. \"We would say to him 'don't increase your public spending, don't give it away. But if you are going to anywhere, just add something to the competitiveness of Britain, put it into skilling our people'. \"That would be a good way to spend any excess.\"\\n\\nMr Balls refused to say whether Mr Brown would remain as chancellor after the election, amid speculation he will be offered the job of Foreign Secretary. \"I think that Gordon Brown wants to be part of the successful Labour government which delivers in the third term for the priorities of the people and sees off a Conservative Party that will take Britain backwards,\" Mr Balls told Today. Prime Minister Tony Blair has yet to name the date of the election, but most pundits are betting on 5 May.\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>Blair 'up for it' ahead of poll\\n\\nTony Blair says his personal standing in the eyes of voters will be \"an issue\" in the general election.\\n\\nThe prime minister said he was \"up for it\" as the country waits to go to the polls, possibly in a matter of weeks. He told The Observer government life was a \"constant barrage of attack\" but said he would not stay in charge if he felt unable to contribute. Mr Blair also spoke of meeting many people across the country with concerns about the compensation culture.\\n\\nHe said Britain was in danger of needless panic over public safety issues.\\n\\nSpeaking amid a flurry of pre-election campaigning, the prime minister said: \"I am an issue, I always will be. Whoever is the prime minister will be.\" He added: \"If you are afraid to take criticism, you should go and do another job.\" Asked if he would quit as leader if he felt like a liability to Labour, he said: \"It's important always not to do the job unless you feel you have something to contribute.\" Whether he still had something to offer, he said, was a judgement for people to make. Mr Blair's assessment is likely to be seen as a signal that replacing him would not bring an upsurge in fortunes for the Labour administration.\\n\\nHis comments come as the co-chairman of the Conservative Party, Liam Fox, on Saturday called him \"a disappointment of historic proportions\" as a prime minister. Mr Blair said he had learned from a series of at times tough encounters with members of the public, during question and answer sessions across the country in recent weeks. He pledged to clamp down on Britain's growing compensation culture, which has brought concerns that doctors, teachers and other professionals are being hampered in their work by the fear of frivolous lawsuits.\\n\\n\"I was quite shocked to be told by people who were running a nursery that they were worried about letting the kids out into the playground when it was wet in case one of them slipped and fell and they ended up having a legal case [against them],\" he said.\\n\\n\"We have got to look at a way of getting people protection on that.\" Mr Blair said the government was also looking at \"how to make sure that legal aid is not abused with actions against doctors and others\", as part of a review being carried out by the Lord Chancellor's Department. And there should be \"real debate\" about the risk posed by public safety threats, he said. \"We are in danger of - depending on whatever is the media campaign of the day - ending up spending literally hundreds, sometimes millions of pounds meeting quite a small risk.\"\\n\\nHis comments come after the government announced it is to spend £200m on drugs to treat a possible outbreak of bird flu, and the Sudan 1 food scare. Meanwhile, Commons leader Peter Hain has warned that on the campaign trail he has seen \"dangerous complacency\" being displayed by Labour voters convinced of a general election victory. If Labour voters \"stayed at home\" in marginal seats they could see Tory leader Michael Howard \"coming in the back door to Number 10 with the tradesman's key to Number 10, getting into power\", he added.\\n</td>\n",

He wants a greater campaigning role for Chancellor Gordon Brown. Labour said the economy was at the heart of the campaign and Mr Brown therefore had a prominent role. But Mr Wyatt argued: \"By some way, he is currently the figure in all of the polls that people trust and see that has delivered over eight years an economy unmatched anywhere in the world. \"So, it would be a tad foolish of the Labour Party if we did not use him as we have done over the past three elections.\"\\n\\nLabour's election chief Alan Milburn denied there was an attempt to sideline Mr Brown after facing criticism for letting the Tories set the agenda. However, Mr Wyatt predicted the campaign would get under way properly once the chancellor delivered his budget. The MP for Sittingbourne and Sheppey said Prime Minister Tony Blair had been \"trying very hard\" to improve his own standing with the electorate through a \"sort of campaign of trust\". But Mr Blair had been \"hurt\" by the Iraq controversy, he added. A Labour party spokesman played down differences with Mr Wyatt and said Mr Brown already had a prominent campaign role. \"This election is a choice between Labour taking Britain forward and the Conservatives taking us back.\"\\n</td>\n",

Others targeted include Oliver Letwin, David Davis and Theresa May, Lib Dem's elections chief Lord Rennard said. He said it was \"nothing personal\" but that \"very many of the prominent Conservatives\" had slender leads in seats where the Lib Dems were second.\\n\\nIn 2001, Michael Howard won the Folkestone &amp; Hythe seat with 20,645 votes, compared to 14,738 for the Liberal Democrat candidate Peter Carroll, giving the Tory leader a majority of 5,907. Asked if this amounted to the party's much vaunted \"decapitation strategy\" Lord Rennard said it was not a term he had ever used. But he urged Labour supporters to vote tactically to remove prominent Conservatives. \"I just don't think Labour voters in these sort of seats could resist the temptation to use their votes effectively to remove a Conservative.\" He denied this strategy was opportunism, insisting the Lib Dem's policies on issues such as tuition fees, the council tax and free care for the elderly appealed \"to all sides of the political spectrum\". \"We are in favour of tactical voting as long as the tactic is to vote Liberal Democrat,\" he added. A Conservative spokesperson said: \"The Liberal Democrats can talk all they like about strategy. The problem the Liberal Democrats face is that a large number of Lib Dem voters do not agree with their policies. \"We will be pointing out how they are soft on crime, how they support higher taxes, their opposition to controlled immigration and support for giving Europe more control over our lives\".\\n</td>\n",

He told delegates that Labour had abused the public's trust and that the Tories had failed to oppose them. In response, the Conservatives insisted that theirs was the party that understood the \"forgotten majority\".\\n\\nSpeaking in Harrogate Mr Kennedy said: \"People want a credible, principled political party which offers a different vision of what Britain can be.\"\\n\\nOnly the Liberal Democrats stood against the Iraq war, he said, and they had also provided strong opposition to the government's plans on ID cards, anti-terror measures and taxation. He said: \"If you voted Conservative in 2001 ... what good did it do you? Your vote was wasted. \"What people needed was ... a party which was listening to their concerns; a party which was prepared to stand up and say so; a party which said no to the prime minister.\" Responding to the claims Tory Party co-chairman Liam Fox said: \"Like Labour, the Lib Dems are soft on crime, support higher taxes, oppose controlled immigration and support giving Europe more control over our lives.\"\\n\\nMr Kennedy also outlined his party's plan to impose a 50% income tax rate on earnings over £100,000 a year. The money would be used to help pay for key policies such as abolishing university tuition fees, scrapping council tax in favour of local income tax, and providing free care for the elderly, he said. Labour and the Tories claim the sums do not add up, and that working families would be hardest hit. Mr Kennedy said: \"Britain is the fourth-largest economy in the world. We have world class businesses and a world class workforce.\\n\\n\"So why are two million of our pensioners living below the poverty line?\" All the parties are campaigning hard for an expected election in May, although Prime Minister Tony Blair has not confirmed any timing. Earlier, Mr Kennedy told Radio 4's Today programme there was no possibility of forming a coalition with Labour in the event of a hung Parliament. \"We go into the election as an independent party and we come out as an independent party,\" he said. Mr Kennedy has been under fire in recent days for missing Monday's Commons vote on the government's controversial anti-terrorism laws, along with 16 other Lib Dem MPs. On Saturday, the Lib Dem chief executive said it was \"just a cock-up\" that Mr Kennedy and his colleagues missed the vote, which the government won by a majority of only 14. \"Nobody had any idea that was going to happen,\" Lord Rennard told reporters at the party conference. He said he was certain MPs would get another chance to vote against the plans.\\n</td>\n",

Other plans include letting maternity pay be given to fathers and extending rights to parents of older children. The Tories dismissed the maternity pay plan as \"desperate\", while the Liberal Democrats said it was misdirected.\\n\\nMs Hewitt said: \"We have already doubled the length of maternity pay, it was 13 weeks when we were elected, we have already taken it up to 26 weeks. \"We are going to extend the pay to nine months by 2007 and the aim is to get it right up to the full 12 months by the end of the next Parliament.\" She said new mothers were already entitled to 12 months leave, but that many women could not take it as only six of those months were paid. \"We have made a firm commitment. We will definitely extend the maternity pay, from the six months where it now is to nine months, that's the extra £1,400.\" She said ministers would consult on other proposals that could see fathers being allowed to take some of their partner's maternity pay or leave period, or extending the rights of flexible working to carers or parents of older children. The Shadow Secretary of State for the Family, Theresa May, said: \"These plans were announced by Gordon Brown in his pre-budget review in December and Tony Blair is now recycling it in his desperate bid to win back women voters.\"\\n\\nShe said the Conservatives would announce their proposals closer to the General Election. Liberal Democrat spokeswoman for women Sandra Gidley said: \"While mothers would welcome any extra maternity pay the Liberal Democrats feel this money is being misdirected.\" She said her party would boost maternity pay in the first six months to allow more women to stay at home in that time.\\n\\nMs Hewitt also stressed the plans would be paid for by taxpayers, not employers. But David Frost, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, warned that many small firms could be \"crippled\" by the move. \"While the majority of any salary costs may be covered by the government's statutory pay, recruitment costs, advertising costs, retraining costs and the strain on the company will not be,\" he said. Further details of the government's plans will be outlined on Monday. New mothers are currently entitled to 90% of average earnings for the first six weeks after giving birth, followed by £102.80 a week until the baby is six months old.\\n   \n",

Government guidance said e-mails should only be deleted if they served \"no current purpose\", Mr Thomas said. The Tories and the Lib Dems have questioned the timing of the new rules.\\n\\nTory leader Michael Howard has written to Tony Blair demanding an explanation of the new rules on e-mail retention. On Monday Lib Dem constitutional affairs committee chairman Alan Beith warned that the deletion of millions of government e-mails could harm the ability of key probes like the Hutton Inquiry. The timing of the new rules just before the Freedom of Information Act comes into forces was \"too unlikely to have been a coincidence\", Mr Beith said. But a Cabinet Office spokeswoman said the move was not about the new laws or \"the destruction of important records\". Mr Beith urged the information commissioner to look at how the \"e-mail regime\" could \"support the freedom of information regime\".\\n\\nMr Thomas said: \"The new Act of Parliament makes it very clear that to destroy records in order to prevent their disclosure becomes a criminal offence.\" He said there was already clear guidance on the retention of e-mails contained in a code of practice from the lord chancellor. All e-mails are subject to the freedom of information laws, but the important thing was the content of the e-mail, said Mr Thomas.\\n\\n\"If in doubt retain, that has been the long-standing principle of the civil service and public authorities. It's only when you've got no further use for the particular record that it may be legitimate to destroy it. \"But any deliberate destruction to avoid the possibility of later disclosure is to be totally condemned.\" The Freedom of Information Act will cover England, Wales and Northern Ireland from next year. Similar measures are being brought in at the same time in Scotland. It provides the public with a right of access to information held by about 100,000 public bodies, subject to various exemptions. Its implementation will be monitored by the information commissioner.\\n   \n",
       "2    Hewitt decries 'career sexism'\\n\\nPlans to extend paid maternity leave beyond six months should be prominent in Labour's election manifesto, the Trade and Industry Secretary has said.\\n\\nPatricia Hewitt said the cost of the proposals was being evaluated, but it was an \"increasingly high priority\" and a \"shared goal across government\". Ms Hewitt was speaking at a gender and productivity seminar organised by the Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC). Mothers can currently take up to six months' paid leave - and six unpaid. Ms Hewitt told the seminar: \"Clearly, one of the things we need to do in the future is to extend the period of payment for maternity leave beyond the first six months into the second six months. \"We are looking at how quickly we can do that, because obviously there are cost implications because the taxpayer reimburses the employers for the cost of that.\"\\n\\nMs Hewitt also announced a new drive to help women who want to work in male dominated sectors, saying sexism at work was still preventing women reaching their full potential. Plans include funding for universities to help female science and engineering graduates find jobs and \"taster courses\" for men and women in non-traditional jobs. Women in full-time work earn 19% less than men, according to the Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC).\\n\\nThe minister told delegates that getting rid of \"career sexism\" was vital to closing the gender pay gap.\\n\\n\"Career sexism limits opportunities for women of all ages and prevents them from achieving their full potential. \"It is simply wrong to assume someone cannot do a job on the grounds of their sex,\" she said. Earlier, she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"What we are talking about here is the fact that about six out of 20 women work in jobs that are low-paid and typically dominated by women, so we have got very segregated employment. \"Unfortunately, in some cases, this reflects very old-fashioned and stereotypical ideas about the appropriate jobs for women, or indeed for men. \"Career sexism is about saying that engineering, for instance, where only 10% of employees are women, is really a male-dominated industry. Construction is even worse. \"But it is also about saying childcare jobs are really there for women and not suitable for men. Career sexism goes both ways.\"\\n\\nShe added that while progress had been made, there was still a gap in pay figures. \"The average woman working full-time is being paid about 80p for every pound a man is earning. For women working part-time it is 60p.\" The Department for Trade and Industry will also provide funding to help a new pay experts panel run by the TUC.\\n\\nIt has been set up to advise hundreds of companies on equal wage policies. Research conducted by the EOC last year revealed that many Britons believe the pay gap between men and women is the result of \"natural differences\" between the sexes. Women hold less than 10% of the top positions in FTSE 100 companies, the police, the judiciary and trade unions, according to their figures. And retired women have just over half the income of their male counterparts on average.\\n   \n",

It will be the first time since 1917 that the party has chosen Manchester to host the annual event. Blackpool will get the much smaller February spring conference instead in what will be seen as a placatory move.\\n\\nFor years the main political parties have rotated between Blackpool, Bournemouth and Brighton. And the news the much larger annual conference is not to gather in Blackpool will be seen as a blow in the coastal resort. In 1998 the party said it would not return to Blackpool but did so in 2002. The following year Bournemouth hosted the event before the party signed a two year deal for Brighton to host the autumn conference.\\n\\nColin Asplin, Blackpool Hotel Association said: \"We have tried very hard to make sure they come back to Blackpool. \"Obviously we have failed in that. I just hope Manchester can handle the crowds. \"It amazes me that the Labour Party, which is a working class party, doesn't want to come to the main working class resort in the country.\" The exact cost to Blackpool in terms of lost revenue for hotel accommodation is not yet known but it is thought that block bookings will be taken at the major Manchester hotels after the official announcement.\\n   \n",

But Mr Balls, a prospective Labour MP, said he was confident the chancellor would meet his fiscal rules. He was speaking as Sir Digby Jones, CBI director general, warned Mr Brown not to be tempted to use any extra cash on pre-election bribes.\\n\\nMr Balls, who stepped down from his Treasury post to stand as a Labour candidate in the election, had suggested that Mr Brown would meet his golden economic rule - \"with a margin to spare\". He said he hoped more would be done to build on current tax credit rules.\\n\\nHe also stressed rise in interest rates ahead of an expected May election would not affect the Labour Party's chances of winning. Expectations of a rate rise have gathered pace after figures showed house prices are still rising. Consumer borrowing rose at a near-record pace in January. \"If the MPC (the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee) were to judge that a rate rise was justified before the election because of the strength of the economy - and I'm not predicting that they will - I do not believe that this will be a big election issue in Britain for Labour,\" he told a Parliamentary lunch. \"This is a big change in our political culture.\"\\n\\nDuring an interview with BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Balls said he was sure Mr Brown's Budget would not put at risk the stability of the economy. \"I don't think we'll see a pre-election spending spree - we certainly did not see that before 2001,\" he said.\\n\\nHis assurances came after Sir Digby Jones said stability was all important and any extra cash should be spent on improving workers' skills. His message to the chancellor was: \"Please don't give it away in any form of electioneering.\" Sir Digby added: \"I don't think he will. I have to say he has been a prudent chancellor right the way through. Stability is the key word - British business needs boring stability more than anything. \"We would say to him 'don't increase your public spending, don't give it away. But if you are going to anywhere, just add something to the competitiveness of Britain, put it into skilling our people'. \"That would be a good way to spend any excess.\"\\n\\nMr Balls refused to say whether Mr Brown would remain as chancellor after the election, amid speculation he will be offered the job of Foreign Secretary. \"I think that Gordon Brown wants to be part of the successful Labour government which delivers in the third term for the priorities of the people and sees off a Conservative Party that will take Britain backwards,\" Mr Balls told Today. Prime Minister Tony Blair has yet to name the date of the election, but most pundits are betting on 5 May.\\n   \n",

       "413    Blair 'up for it' ahead of poll\\n\\nTony Blair says his personal standing in the eyes of voters will be \"an issue\" in the general election.\\n\\nThe prime minister said he was \"up for it\" as the country waits to go to the polls, possibly in a matter of weeks. He told The Observer government life was a \"constant barrage of attack\" but said he would not stay in charge if he felt unable to contribute. Mr Blair also spoke of meeting many people across the country with concerns about the compensation culture.\\n\\nHe said Britain was in danger of needless panic over public safety issues.\\n\\nSpeaking amid a flurry of pre-election campaigning, the prime minister said: \"I am an issue, I always will be. Whoever is the prime minister will be.\" He added: \"If you are afraid to take criticism, you should go and do another job.\" Asked if he would quit as leader if he felt like a liability to Labour, he said: \"It's important always not to do the job unless you feel you have something to contribute.\" Whether he still had something to offer, he said, was a judgement for people to make. Mr Blair's assessment is likely to be seen as a signal that replacing him would not bring an upsurge in fortunes for the Labour administration.\\n\\nHis comments come as the co-chairman of the Conservative Party, Liam Fox, on Saturday called him \"a disappointment of historic proportions\" as a prime minister. Mr Blair said he had learned from a series of at times tough encounters with members of the public, during question and answer sessions across the country in recent weeks. He pledged to clamp down on Britain's growing compensation culture, which has brought concerns that doctors, teachers and other professionals are being hampered in their work by the fear of frivolous lawsuits.\\n\\n\"I was quite shocked to be told by people who were running a nursery that they were worried about letting the kids out into the playground when it was wet in case one of them slipped and fell and they ended up having a legal case [against them],\" he said.\\n\\n\"We have got to look at a way of getting people protection on that.\" Mr Blair said the government was also looking at \"how to make sure that legal aid is not abused with actions against doctors and others\", as part of a review being carried out by the Lord Chancellor's Department. And there should be \"real debate\" about the risk posed by public safety threats, he said. \"We are in danger of - depending on whatever is the media campaign of the day - ending up spending literally hundreds, sometimes millions of pounds meeting quite a small risk.\"\\n\\nHis comments come after the government announced it is to spend £200m on drugs to treat a possible outbreak of bird flu, and the Sudan 1 food scare. Meanwhile, Commons leader Peter Hain has warned that on the campaign trail he has seen \"dangerous complacency\" being displayed by Labour voters convinced of a general election victory. If Labour voters \"stayed at home\" in marginal seats they could see Tory leader Michael Howard \"coming in the back door to Number 10 with the tradesman's key to Number 10, getting into power\", he added.\\n   \n",

He wants a greater campaigning role for Chancellor Gordon Brown. Labour said the economy was at the heart of the campaign and Mr Brown therefore had a prominent role. But Mr Wyatt argued: \"By some way, he is currently the figure in all of the polls that people trust and see that has delivered over eight years an economy unmatched anywhere in the world. \"So, it would be a tad foolish of the Labour Party if we did not use him as we have done over the past three elections.\"\\n\\nLabour's election chief Alan Milburn denied there was an attempt to sideline Mr Brown after facing criticism for letting the Tories set the agenda. However, Mr Wyatt predicted the campaign would get under way properly once the chancellor delivered his budget. The MP for Sittingbourne and Sheppey said Prime Minister Tony Blair had been \"trying very hard\" to improve his own standing with the electorate through a \"sort of campaign of trust\". But Mr Blair had been \"hurt\" by the Iraq controversy, he added. A Labour party spokesman played down differences with Mr Wyatt and said Mr Brown already had a prominent campaign role. \"This election is a choice between Labour taking Britain forward and the Conservatives taking us back.\"\\n   \n",

Others targeted include Oliver Letwin, David Davis and Theresa May, Lib Dem's elections chief Lord Rennard said. He said it was \"nothing personal\" but that \"very many of the prominent Conservatives\" had slender leads in seats where the Lib Dems were second.\\n\\nIn 2001, Michael Howard won the Folkestone & Hythe seat with 20,645 votes, compared to 14,738 for the Liberal Democrat candidate Peter Carroll, giving the Tory leader a majority of 5,907. Asked if this amounted to the party's much vaunted \"decapitation strategy\" Lord Rennard said it was not a term he had ever used. But he urged Labour supporters to vote tactically to remove prominent Conservatives. \"I just don't think Labour voters in these sort of seats could resist the temptation to use their votes effectively to remove a Conservative.\" He denied this strategy was opportunism, insisting the Lib Dem's policies on issues such as tuition fees, the council tax and free care for the elderly appealed \"to all sides of the political spectrum\". \"We are in favour of tactical voting as long as the tactic is to vote Liberal Democrat,\" he added. A Conservative spokesperson said: \"The Liberal Democrats can talk all they like about strategy. The problem the Liberal Democrats face is that a large number of Lib Dem voters do not agree with their policies. \"We will be pointing out how they are soft on crime, how they support higher taxes, their opposition to controlled immigration and support for giving Europe more control over our lives\".\\n   \n",

He told delegates that Labour had abused the public's trust and that the Tories had failed to oppose them. In response, the Conservatives insisted that theirs was the party that understood the \"forgotten majority\".\\n\\nSpeaking in Harrogate Mr Kennedy said: \"People want a credible, principled political party which offers a different vision of what Britain can be.\"\\n\\nOnly the Liberal Democrats stood against the Iraq war, he said, and they had also provided strong opposition to the government's plans on ID cards, anti-terror measures and taxation. He said: \"If you voted Conservative in 2001 ... what good did it do you? Your vote was wasted. \"What people needed was ... a party which was listening to their concerns; a party which was prepared to stand up and say so; a party which said no to the prime minister.\" Responding to the claims Tory Party co-chairman Liam Fox said: \"Like Labour, the Lib Dems are soft on crime, support higher taxes, oppose controlled immigration and support giving Europe more control over our lives.\"\\n\\nMr Kennedy also outlined his party's plan to impose a 50% income tax rate on earnings over £100,000 a year. The money would be used to help pay for key policies such as abolishing university tuition fees, scrapping council tax in favour of local income tax, and providing free care for the elderly, he said. Labour and the Tories claim the sums do not add up, and that working families would be hardest hit. Mr Kennedy said: \"Britain is the fourth-largest economy in the world. We have world class businesses and a world class workforce.\\n\\n\"So why are two million of our pensioners living below the poverty line?\" All the parties are campaigning hard for an expected election in May, although Prime Minister Tony Blair has not confirmed any timing. Earlier, Mr Kennedy told Radio 4's Today programme there was no possibility of forming a coalition with Labour in the event of a hung Parliament. \"We go into the election as an independent party and we come out as an independent party,\" he said. Mr Kennedy has been under fire in recent days for missing Monday's Commons vote on the government's controversial anti-terrorism laws, along with 16 other Lib Dem MPs. On Saturday, the Lib Dem chief executive said it was \"just a cock-up\" that Mr Kennedy and his colleagues missed the vote, which the government won by a majority of only 14. \"Nobody had any idea that was going to happen,\" Lord Rennard told reporters at the party conference. He said he was certain MPs would get another chance to vote against the plans.\\n   \n",

         "Labour plans maternity pay rise\n\nMaternity pay for new mothers is to rise by £1,400 as part of new proposals announced by the Trade and Industry Secretary Patricia Hewitt.\n\nIt would mean paid leave would be increased to nine months by 2007, Ms Hewitt told GMTV's Sunday programme. Other plans include letting maternity pay be given to fathers and extending rights to parents of older children. The Tories dismissed the maternity pay plan as \"desperate\", while the Liberal Democrats said it was misdirected.\n\nMs Hewitt said: \"We have already doubled the length of maternity pay, it was 13 weeks when we were elected, we have already taken it up to 26 weeks. \"We are going to extend the pay to nine months by 2007 and the aim is to get it right up to the full 12 months by the end of the next Parliament.\" She said new mothers were already entitled to 12 months leave, but that many women could not take it as only six of those months were paid. \"We have made a firm commitment. We will definitely extend the maternity pay, from the six months where it now is to nine months, that's the extra £1,400.\" She said ministers would consult on other proposals that could see fathers being allowed to take some of their partner's maternity pay or leave period, or extending the rights of flexible working to carers or parents of older children. The Shadow Secretary of State for the Family, Theresa May, said: \"These plans were announced by Gordon Brown in his pre-budget review in December and Tony Blair is now recycling it in his desperate bid to win back women voters.\"\n\nShe said the Conservatives would announce their proposals closer to the General Election. Liberal Democrat spokeswoman for women Sandra Gidley said: \"While mothers would welcome any extra maternity pay the Liberal Democrats feel this money is being misdirected.\" She said her party would boost maternity pay in the first six months to allow more women to stay at home in that time.\n\nMs Hewitt also stressed the plans would be paid for by taxpayers, not employers. But David Frost, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, warned that many small firms could be \"crippled\" by the move. \"While the majority of any salary costs may be covered by the government's statutory pay, recruitment costs, advertising costs, retraining costs and the strain on the company will not be,\" he said. Further details of the government's plans will be outlined on Monday. New mothers are currently entitled to 90% of average earnings for the first six weeks after giving birth, followed by £102.80 a week until the baby is six months old.\n",

         "Watchdog probes e-mail deletions\n\nThe information commissioner says he is urgently asking for details of Cabinet Office orders telling staff to delete e-mails more than three months old.\n\nRichard Thomas \"totally condemned\" the deletion of e-mails to prevent their disclosure under freedom of information laws coming into force on 1 January. Government guidance said e-mails should only be deleted if they served \"no current purpose\", Mr Thomas said. The Tories and the Lib Dems have questioned the timing of the new rules.\n\nTory leader Michael Howard has written to Tony Blair demanding an explanation of the new rules on e-mail retention. On Monday Lib Dem constitutional affairs committee chairman Alan Beith warned that the deletion of millions of government e-mails could harm the ability of key probes like the Hutton Inquiry. The timing of the new rules just before the Freedom of Information Act comes into forces was \"too unlikely to have been a coincidence\", Mr Beith said. But a Cabinet Office spokeswoman said the move was not about the new laws or \"the destruction of important records\". Mr Beith urged the information commissioner to look at how the \"e-mail regime\" could \"support the freedom of information regime\".\n\nMr Thomas said: \"The new Act of Parliament makes it very clear that to destroy records in order to prevent their disclosure becomes a criminal offence.\" He said there was already clear guidance on the retention of e-mails contained in a code of practice from the lord chancellor. All e-mails are subject to the freedom of information laws, but the important thing was the content of the e-mail, said Mr Thomas.\n\n\"If in doubt retain, that has been the long-standing principle of the civil service and public authorities. It's only when you've got no further use for the particular record that it may be legitimate to destroy it. \"But any deliberate destruction to avoid the possibility of later disclosure is to be totally condemned.\" The Freedom of Information Act will cover England, Wales and Northern Ireland from next year. Similar measures are being brought in at the same time in Scotland. It provides the public with a right of access to information held by about 100,000 public bodies, subject to various exemptions. Its implementation will be monitored by the information commissioner.\n",

         "Hewitt decries 'career sexism'\n\nPlans to extend paid maternity leave beyond six months should be prominent in Labour's election manifesto, the Trade and Industry Secretary has said.\n\nPatricia Hewitt said the cost of the proposals was being evaluated, but it was an \"increasingly high priority\" and a \"shared goal across government\". Ms Hewitt was speaking at a gender and productivity seminar organised by the Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC). Mothers can currently take up to six months' paid leave - and six unpaid. Ms Hewitt told the seminar: \"Clearly, one of the things we need to do in the future is to extend the period of payment for maternity leave beyond the first six months into the second six months. \"We are looking at how quickly we can do that, because obviously there are cost implications because the taxpayer reimburses the employers for the cost of that.\"\n\nMs Hewitt also announced a new drive to help women who want to work in male dominated sectors, saying sexism at work was still preventing women reaching their full potential. Plans include funding for universities to help female science and engineering graduates find jobs and \"taster courses\" for men and women in non-traditional jobs. Women in full-time work earn 19% less than men, according to the Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC).\n\nThe minister told delegates that getting rid of \"career sexism\" was vital to closing the gender pay gap.\n\n\"Career sexism limits opportunities for women of all ages and prevents them from achieving their full potential. \"It is simply wrong to assume someone cannot do a job on the grounds of their sex,\" she said. Earlier, she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"What we are talking about here is the fact that about six out of 20 women work in jobs that are low-paid and typically dominated by women, so we have got very segregated employment. \"Unfortunately, in some cases, this reflects very old-fashioned and stereotypical ideas about the appropriate jobs for women, or indeed for men. \"Career sexism is about saying that engineering, for instance, where only 10% of employees are women, is really a male-dominated industry. Construction is even worse. \"But it is also about saying childcare jobs are really there for women and not suitable for men. Career sexism goes both ways.\"\n\nShe added that while progress had been made, there was still a gap in pay figures. \"The average woman working full-time is being paid about 80p for every pound a man is earning. For women working part-time it is 60p.\" The Department for Trade and Industry will also provide funding to help a new pay experts panel run by the TUC.\n\nIt has been set up to advise hundreds of companies on equal wage policies. Research conducted by the EOC last year revealed that many Britons believe the pay gap between men and women is the result of \"natural differences\" between the sexes. Women hold less than 10% of the top positions in FTSE 100 companies, the police, the judiciary and trade unions, according to their figures. And retired women have just over half the income of their male counterparts on average.\n",

         "Labour chooses Manchester\n\nThe Labour Party will hold its 2006 autumn conference in Manchester and not Blackpool, it has been confirmed.\n\nThe much trailed decision was ratified by Labour's ruling National Executive Committee in a break with the traditional choice of a seaside venue. It will be the first time since 1917 that the party has chosen Manchester to host the annual event. Blackpool will get the much smaller February spring conference instead in what will be seen as a placatory move.\n\nFor years the main political parties have rotated between Blackpool, Bournemouth and Brighton. And the news the much larger annual conference is not to gather in Blackpool will be seen as a blow in the coastal resort. In 1998 the party said it would not return to Blackpool but did so in 2002. The following year Bournemouth hosted the event before the party signed a two year deal for Brighton to host the autumn conference.\n\nColin Asplin, Blackpool Hotel Association said: \"We have tried very hard to make sure they come back to Blackpool. \"Obviously we have failed in that. I just hope Manchester can handle the crowds. \"It amazes me that the Labour Party, which is a working class party, doesn't want to come to the main working class resort in the country.\" The exact cost to Blackpool in terms of lost revenue for hotel accommodation is not yet known but it is thought that block bookings will be taken at the major Manchester hotels after the official announcement.\n",

         "Brown ally rejects Budget spree\n\nChancellor Gordon Brown's closest ally has denied suggestions there will be a Budget giveaway on 16 March.\n\nEd Balls, ex-chief economic adviser to the Treasury, said there would be no spending spree before polling day. But Mr Balls, a prospective Labour MP, said he was confident the chancellor would meet his fiscal rules. He was speaking as Sir Digby Jones, CBI director general, warned Mr Brown not to be tempted to use any extra cash on pre-election bribes.\n\nMr Balls, who stepped down from his Treasury post to stand as a Labour candidate in the election, had suggested that Mr Brown would meet his golden economic rule - \"with a margin to spare\". He said he hoped more would be done to build on current tax credit rules.\n\nHe also stressed rise in interest rates ahead of an expected May election would not affect the Labour Party's chances of winning. Expectations of a rate rise have gathered pace after figures showed house prices are still rising. Consumer borrowing rose at a near-record pace in January. \"If the MPC (the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee) were to judge that a rate rise was justified before the election because of the strength of the economy - and I'm not predicting that they will - I do not believe that this will be a big election issue in Britain for Labour,\" he told a Parliamentary lunch. \"This is a big change in our political culture.\"\n\nDuring an interview with BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Balls said he was sure Mr Brown's Budget would not put at risk the stability of the economy. \"I don't think we'll see a pre-election spending spree - we certainly did not see that before 2001,\" he said.\n\nHis assurances came after Sir Digby Jones said stability was all important and any extra cash should be spent on improving workers' skills. His message to the chancellor was: \"Please don't give it away in any form of electioneering.\" Sir Digby added: \"I don't think he will. I have to say he has been a prudent chancellor right the way through. Stability is the key word - British business needs boring stability more than anything. \"We would say to him 'don't increase your public spending, don't give it away. But if you are going to anywhere, just add something to the competitiveness of Britain, put it into skilling our people'. \"That would be a good way to spend any excess.\"\n\nMr Balls refused to say whether Mr Brown would remain as chancellor after the election, amid speculation he will be offered the job of Foreign Secretary. \"I think that Gordon Brown wants to be part of the successful Labour government which delivers in the third term for the priorities of the people and sees off a Conservative Party that will take Britain backwards,\" Mr Balls told Today. Prime Minister Tony Blair has yet to name the date of the election, but most pundits are betting on 5 May.\n",

       "      <td>Labour plans maternity pay rise\\n\\nMaternity pay for new mothers is to rise by £1,400 as part of new proposals announced by the Trade and Industry Secretary Patricia Hewitt.\\n\\nIt would mean paid leave would be increased to nine months by 2007, Ms Hewitt told GMTV's Sunday programme. Other plans include letting maternity pay be given to fathers and extending rights to parents of older children. The Tories dismissed the maternity pay plan as \"desperate\", while the Liberal Democrats said it was misdirected.\\n\\nMs Hewitt said: \"We have already doubled the length of maternity pay, it was 13 weeks when we were elected, we have already taken it up to 26 weeks. \"We are going to extend the pay to nine months by 2007 and the aim is to get it right up to the full 12 months by the end of the next Parliament.\" She said new mothers were already entitled to 12 months leave, but that many women could not take it as only six of those months were paid. \"We have made a firm commitment. We will definitely extend the maternity pay, from the six months where it now is to nine months, that's the extra £1,400.\" She said ministers would consult on other proposals that could see fathers being allowed to take some of their partner's maternity pay or leave period, or extending the rights of flexible working to carers or parents of older children. The Shadow Secretary of State for the Family, Theresa May, said: \"These plans were announced by Gordon Brown in his pre-budget review in December and Tony Blair is now recycling it in his desperate bid to win back women voters.\"\\n\\nShe said the Conservatives would announce their proposals closer to the General Election. Liberal Democrat spokeswoman for women Sandra Gidley said: \"While mothers would welcome any extra maternity pay the Liberal Democrats feel this money is being misdirected.\" She said her party would boost maternity pay in the first six months to allow more women to stay at home in that time.\\n\\nMs Hewitt also stressed the plans would be paid for by taxpayers, not employers. But David Frost, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, warned that many small firms could be \"crippled\" by the move. \"While the majority of any salary costs may be covered by the government's statutory pay, recruitment costs, advertising costs, retraining costs and the strain on the company will not be,\" he said. Further details of the government's plans will be outlined on Monday. New mothers are currently entitled to 90% of average earnings for the first six weeks after giving birth, followed by £102.80 a week until the baby is six months old.\\n</td>\n",

Government guidance said e-mails should only be deleted if they served \"no current purpose\", Mr Thomas said. The Tories and the Lib Dems have questioned the timing of the new rules.\\n\\nTory leader Michael Howard has written to Tony Blair demanding an explanation of the new rules on e-mail retention. On Monday Lib Dem constitutional affairs committee chairman Alan Beith warned that the deletion of millions of government e-mails could harm the ability of key probes like the Hutton Inquiry. The timing of the new rules just before the Freedom of Information Act comes into forces was \"too unlikely to have been a coincidence\", Mr Beith said. But a Cabinet Office spokeswoman said the move was not about the new laws or \"the destruction of important records\". Mr Beith urged the information commissioner to look at how the \"e-mail regime\" could \"support the freedom of information regime\".\\n\\nMr Thomas said: \"The new Act of Parliament makes it very clear that to destroy records in order to prevent their disclosure becomes a criminal offence.\" He said there was already clear guidance on the retention of e-mails contained in a code of practice from the lord chancellor. All e-mails are subject to the freedom of information laws, but the important thing was the content of the e-mail, said Mr Thomas.\\n\\n\"If in doubt retain, that has been the long-standing principle of the civil service and public authorities. It's only when you've got no further use for the particular record that it may be legitimate to destroy it. \"But any deliberate destruction to avoid the possibility of later disclosure is to be totally condemned.\" The Freedom of Information Act will cover England, Wales and Northern Ireland from next year. Similar measures are being brought in at the same time in Scotland. It provides the public with a right of access to information held by about 100,000 public bodies, subject to various exemptions. Its implementation will be monitored by the information commissioner.\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>Hewitt decries 'career sexism'\\n\\nPlans to extend paid maternity leave beyond six months should be prominent in Labour's election manifesto, the Trade and Industry Secretary has said.\\n\\nPatricia Hewitt said the cost of the proposals was being evaluated, but it was an \"increasingly high priority\" and a \"shared goal across government\". Ms Hewitt was speaking at a gender and productivity seminar organised by the Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC). Mothers can currently take up to six months' paid leave - and six unpaid. Ms Hewitt told the seminar: \"Clearly, one of the things we need to do in the future is to extend the period of payment for maternity leave beyond the first six months into the second six months. \"We are looking at how quickly we can do that, because obviously there are cost implications because the taxpayer reimburses the employers for the cost of that.\"\\n\\nMs Hewitt also announced a new drive to help women who want to work in male dominated sectors, saying sexism at work was still preventing women reaching their full potential. Plans include funding for universities to help female science and engineering graduates find jobs and \"taster courses\" for men and women in non-traditional jobs. Women in full-time work earn 19% less than men, according to the Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC).\\n\\nThe minister told delegates that getting rid of \"career sexism\" was vital to closing the gender pay gap.\\n\\n\"Career sexism limits opportunities for women of all ages and prevents them from achieving their full potential. \"It is simply wrong to assume someone cannot do a job on the grounds of their sex,\" she said. Earlier, she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"What we are talking about here is the fact that about six out of 20 women work in jobs that are low-paid and typically dominated by women, so we have got very segregated employment. \"Unfortunately, in some cases, this reflects very old-fashioned and stereotypical ideas about the appropriate jobs for women, or indeed for men. \"Career sexism is about saying that engineering, for instance, where only 10% of employees are women, is really a male-dominated industry. Construction is even worse. \"But it is also about saying childcare jobs are really there for women and not suitable for men. Career sexism goes both ways.\"\\n\\nShe added that while progress had been made, there was still a gap in pay figures. \"The average woman working full-time is being paid about 80p for every pound a man is earning. For women working part-time it is 60p.\" The Department for Trade and Industry will also provide funding to help a new pay experts panel run by the TUC.\\n\\nIt has been set up to advise hundreds of companies on equal wage policies. Research conducted by the EOC last year revealed that many Britons believe the pay gap between men and women is the result of \"natural differences\" between the sexes. Women hold less than 10% of the top positions in FTSE 100 companies, the police, the judiciary and trade unions, according to their figures. And retired women have just over half the income of their male counterparts on average.\\n</td>\n",

Other plans include letting maternity pay be given to fathers and extending rights to parents of older children. The Tories dismissed the maternity pay plan as \"desperate\", while the Liberal Democrats said it was misdirected.\\n\\nMs Hewitt said: \"We have already doubled the length of maternity pay, it was 13 weeks when we were elected, we have already taken it up to 26 weeks. \"We are going to extend the pay to nine months by 2007 and the aim is to get it right up to the full 12 months by the end of the next Parliament.\" She said new mothers were already entitled to 12 months leave, but that many women could not take it as only six of those months were paid. \"We have made a firm commitment. We will definitely extend the maternity pay, from the six months where it now is to nine months, that's the extra £1,400.\" She said ministers would consult on other proposals that could see fathers being allowed to take some of their partner's maternity pay or leave period, or extending the rights of flexible working to carers or parents of older children. The Shadow Secretary of State for the Family, Theresa May, said: \"These plans were announced by Gordon Brown in his pre-budget review in December and Tony Blair is now recycling it in his desperate bid to win back women voters.\"\\n\\nShe said the Conservatives would announce their proposals closer to the General Election. Liberal Democrat spokeswoman for women Sandra Gidley said: \"While mothers would welcome any extra maternity pay the Liberal Democrats feel this money is being misdirected.\" She said her party would boost maternity pay in the first six months to allow more women to stay at home in that time.\\n\\nMs Hewitt also stressed the plans would be paid for by taxpayers, not employers. But David Frost, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, warned that many small firms could be \"crippled\" by the move. \"While the majority of any salary costs may be covered by the government's statutory pay, recruitment costs, advertising costs, retraining costs and the strain on the company will not be,\" he said. Further details of the government's plans will be outlined on Monday. New mothers are currently entitled to 90% of average earnings for the first six weeks after giving birth, followed by £102.80 a week until the baby is six months old.\\n   \n",

Government guidance said e-mails should only be deleted if they served \"no current purpose\", Mr Thomas said. The Tories and the Lib Dems have questioned the timing of the new rules.\\n\\nTory leader Michael Howard has written to Tony Blair demanding an explanation of the new rules on e-mail retention. On Monday Lib Dem constitutional affairs committee chairman Alan Beith warned that the deletion of millions of government e-mails could harm the ability of key probes like the Hutton Inquiry. The timing of the new rules just before the Freedom of Information Act comes into forces was \"too unlikely to have been a coincidence\", Mr Beith said. But a Cabinet Office spokeswoman said the move was not about the new laws or \"the destruction of important records\". Mr Beith urged the information commissioner to look at how the \"e-mail regime\" could \"support the freedom of information regime\".\\n\\nMr Thomas said: \"The new Act of Parliament makes it very clear that to destroy records in order to prevent their disclosure becomes a criminal offence.\" He said there was already clear guidance on the retention of e-mails contained in a code of practice from the lord chancellor. All e-mails are subject to the freedom of information laws, but the important thing was the content of the e-mail, said Mr Thomas.\\n\\n\"If in doubt retain, that has been the long-standing principle of the civil service and public authorities. It's only when you've got no further use for the particular record that it may be legitimate to destroy it. \"But any deliberate destruction to avoid the possibility of later disclosure is to be totally condemned.\" The Freedom of Information Act will cover England, Wales and Northern Ireland from next year. Similar measures are being brought in at the same time in Scotland. It provides the public with a right of access to information held by about 100,000 public bodies, subject to various exemptions. Its implementation will be monitored by the information commissioner.\\n   \n",
       "2  Hewitt decries 'career sexism'\\n\\nPlans to extend paid maternity leave beyond six months should be prominent in Labour's election manifesto, the Trade and Industry Secretary has said.\\n\\nPatricia Hewitt said the cost of the proposals was being evaluated, but it was an \"increasingly high priority\" and a \"shared goal across government\". Ms Hewitt was speaking at a gender and productivity seminar organised by the Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC). Mothers can currently take up to six months' paid leave - and six unpaid. Ms Hewitt told the seminar: \"Clearly, one of the things we need to do in the future is to extend the period of payment for maternity leave beyond the first six months into the second six months. \"We are looking at how quickly we can do that, because obviously there are cost implications because the taxpayer reimburses the employers for the cost of that.\"\\n\\nMs Hewitt also announced a new drive to help women who want to work in male dominated sectors, saying sexism at work was still preventing women reaching their full potential. Plans include funding for universities to help female science and engineering graduates find jobs and \"taster courses\" for men and women in non-traditional jobs. Women in full-time work earn 19% less than men, according to the Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC).\\n\\nThe minister told delegates that getting rid of \"career sexism\" was vital to closing the gender pay gap.\\n\\n\"Career sexism limits opportunities for women of all ages and prevents them from achieving their full potential. \"It is simply wrong to assume someone cannot do a job on the grounds of their sex,\" she said. Earlier, she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"What we are talking about here is the fact that about six out of 20 women work in jobs that are low-paid and typically dominated by women, so we have got very segregated employment. \"Unfortunately, in some cases, this reflects very old-fashioned and stereotypical ideas about the appropriate jobs for women, or indeed for men. \"Career sexism is about saying that engineering, for instance, where only 10% of employees are women, is really a male-dominated industry. Construction is even worse. \"But it is also about saying childcare jobs are really there for women and not suitable for men. Career sexism goes both ways.\"\\n\\nShe added that while progress had been made, there was still a gap in pay figures. \"The average woman working full-time is being paid about 80p for every pound a man is earning. For women working part-time it is 60p.\" The Department for Trade and Industry will also provide funding to help a new pay experts panel run by the TUC.\\n\\nIt has been set up to advise hundreds of companies on equal wage policies. Research conducted by the EOC last year revealed that many Britons believe the pay gap between men and women is the result of \"natural differences\" between the sexes. Women hold less than 10% of the top positions in FTSE 100 companies, the police, the judiciary and trade unions, according to their figures. And retired women have just over half the income of their male counterparts on average.\\n   \n",

It will be the first time since 1917 that the party has chosen Manchester to host the annual event. Blackpool will get the much smaller February spring conference instead in what will be seen as a placatory move.\\n\\nFor years the main political parties have rotated between Blackpool, Bournemouth and Brighton. And the news the much larger annual conference is not to gather in Blackpool will be seen as a blow in the coastal resort. In 1998 the party said it would not return to Blackpool but did so in 2002. The following year Bournemouth hosted the event before the party signed a two year deal for Brighton to host the autumn conference.\\n\\nColin Asplin, Blackpool Hotel Association said: \"We have tried very hard to make sure they come back to Blackpool. \"Obviously we have failed in that. I just hope Manchester can handle the crowds. \"It amazes me that the Labour Party, which is a working class party, doesn't want to come to the main working class resort in the country.\" The exact cost to Blackpool in terms of lost revenue for hotel accommodation is not yet known but it is thought that block bookings will be taken at the major Manchester hotels after the official announcement.\\n   \n",
       "4                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           Brown ally rejects Budget spree\\n\\nChancellor Gordon Brown's closest ally has denied suggestions there will be a Budget giveaway on 16 March.\\n\\nEd Balls, ex-chief economic adviser to the Treasury, said there would be no spending spree before polling day. But Mr Balls, a prospective Labour MP, said he was confident the chancellor would meet his fiscal rules. He was speaking as Sir Digby Jones, CBI director general, warned Mr Brown not to be tempted to use any extra cash on pre-election bribes.\\n\\nMr Balls, who stepped down from his Treasury post to stand as a Labour candidate in the election, had suggested that Mr Brown would meet his golden economic rule - \"with a margin to spare\". He said he hoped more would be done to build on current tax credit rules.\\n\\nHe also stressed rise in interest rates ahead of an expected May election would not affect the Labour Party's chances of winning. Expectations of a rate rise have gathered pace after figures showed house prices are still rising. Consumer borrowing rose at a near-record pace in January. \"If the MPC (the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee) were to judge that a rate rise was justified before the election because of the strength of the economy - and I'm not predicting that they will - I do not believe that this will be a big election issue in Britain for Labour,\" he told a Parliamentary lunch. \"This is a big change in our political culture.\"\\n\\nDuring an interview with BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Balls said he was sure Mr Brown's Budget would not put at risk the stability of the economy. \"I don't think we'll see a pre-election spending spree - we certainly did not see that before 2001,\" he said.\\n\\nHis assurances came after Sir Digby Jones said stability was all important and any extra cash should be spent on improving workers' skills. His message to the chancellor was: \"Please don't give it away in any form of electioneering.\" Sir Digby added: \"I don't think he will. I have to say he has been a prudent chancellor right the way through. Stability is the key word - British business needs boring stability more than anything. \"We would say to him 'don't increase your public spending, don't give it away. But if you are going to anywhere, just add something to the competitiveness of Britain, put it into skilling our people'. \"That would be a good way to spend any excess.\"\\n\\nMr Balls refused to say whether Mr Brown would remain as chancellor after the election, amid speculation he will be offered the job of Foreign Secretary. \"I think that Gordon Brown wants to be part of the successful Labour government which delivers in the third term for the priorities of the people and sees off a Conservative Party that will take Britain backwards,\" Mr Balls told Today. Prime Minister Tony Blair has yet to name the date of the election, but most pundits are betting on 5 May.\\n   \n",

In a new report, the Electoral Commission says it is worth debating a £10,000 cap for the future but now is not the right time to introduce it. It also says there should be more state funding for political parties and candidates should be able to spend more on election campaigning.\\n\\nThere were almost £68m in reported donations to political parties in 2001, 2002 and 2003, with nearly £12m of them from individual gifts worth more than £1m. The rules have already been changed so the public can see who gives how much to the parties but the report says there are still public suspicions. The commission says capping donations would mean taxpayers giving parties more cash - something which would first have to be acceptable to the public and shown to work. \"While we are not in principle opposed to the introduction of a donation cap, we do not believe that such a major departure from the existing system now would be sensible,\" says its report. If there was to be a cap, it should be £10,000 - a small enough amount to make a difference but which would have banned £56m in donations between 2001 and 2003.\\n\\nEven without changes the commission does urge political parties to seek out more small-scale donations and suggests there should be income tax relief for gifts under £200. It also suggests increasing state funding for parties to £3m so help can be extended to all parties with at least two members in the House of Commons, European Parliament, Scottish Parliament, Welsh Assembly or Northern Ireland Assembly. And it suggests new ways of boosting election campaigning, seen as a way of improving voter turnout. All local election candidates should be entitled to a free mailshot for campaign leaflets, says the watchdog. And there should be a shift in the amount of money allowed to be spent at elections from a national level to a local level to help politicians engage better with voters.\\n\\nThe report suggests doubling the money which can be spent by candidates, while cutting national spending limits from £20m to £15m. The commission also says the spending limits for general elections should cover the four months before the poll - as happens with other elections. Electoral Commission chairman Sam Younger said: \"There is no doubt that political parties have a vital role to play in maintaining the health of our democracy and for this they need to be adequately resourced. \"Our research has shown that people want to be more informed about party politics and that they want politicians to be more visible and accessible. \"The public are reluctant for the state to fund parties but at the same time are unhappy with large private donations.\" He called for a wider public debate on party funding to find the consensus needed for radical changes to the current system.\\n   \n",

If there was to be a cap, it should be £10,000 - a small enough amount to make a difference but which would have banned £56m in donations between 2001 and 2003.\\n\\nEven without changes the commission does urge political parties to seek out more small-scale donations and suggests there should be income tax relief for gifts under £200. It also suggests increasing state funding for parties to £3m so help can be extended to all parties with at least two members in the House of Commons, European Parliament, Scottish Parliament, Welsh Assembly or Northern Ireland Assembly. And it suggests new ways of boosting election campaigning, seen as a way of improving voter turnout. All local election candidates should be entitled to a free mailshot for campaign leaflets, says the watchdog. And there should be a shift in the amount of money allowed to be spent at elections from a national level to a local level to help politicians engage better with voters.\\n\\nThe report suggests doubling the money which can be spent by candidates, while cutting national spending limits from £20m to £15m. The commission also says the spending limits for general elections should cover the four months before the poll - as happens with other elections. Electoral Commission chairman Sam Younger said: \"There is no doubt that political parties have a vital role to play in maintaining the health of our democracy and for this they need to be adequately resourced. \"Our research has shown that people want to be more informed about party politics and that they want politicians to be more visible and accessible. \"The public are reluctant for the state to fund parties but at the same time are unhappy with large private donations.\" He called for a wider public debate on party funding to find the consensus needed for radical changes to the current system.\\n   \n",

And that would be central to Labour's next election campaign, planning for which was already well advanced. Mr Brown earlier denied his economic forecasts were too optimistic - but refused to rule out future tax rises.\\n\\nHe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"No politician should make the mistake that John Major and his colleagues made in 1992 of saying no matter what the circumstances are, they can make all sorts of guarantees on every individual thing.\\n\\n\"That is not what politicians should do, it would not be responsible to do.\" Mr Brown insisted his spending plans were \"affordable\" and he could afford to be optimistic because Britain was now a stable, low-inflation economy and house prices were now stabilising. Mr Blair praised his chancellor for his role in creating economic stability, which he said was the \"cornerstone\" of Labour's programme.\\n\\nIn a speech at Edinburgh's Napier University, he said Labour would publish over the next few months \"a rich agenda for future policy in any possible third term\".\\n\\n\"In every area of work there is a detailed plan for the future, much clearer than those in 1997 or 2001. All of it fits together around common themes of opportunity, security and stability for all,\" Mr Blair said. In his pre-Budget report, Mr Brown surprised some City experts by forecasting UK growth at between 3% and 3.5% for next year. Many believe the figure is more likely to be under 3% - and fear tax rises or spending cuts, saying tax receipts have been overestimated. Carl Emmerson, from the Institute for Fiscal Studies, told BBC News: \"He thinks everything will come out in the wash and it will, in fact, be OK.

And that would be central to Labour's next election campaign, planning for which was already well advanced. Mr Brown earlier denied his economic forecasts were too optimistic - but refused to rule out future tax rises.\\n\\nHe told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"No politician should make the mistake that John Major and his colleagues made in 1992 of saying no matter what the circumstances are, they can make all sorts of guarantees on every individual thing.\\n\\n\"That is not what politicians should do, it would not be responsible to do.\" Mr Brown insisted his spending plans were \"affordable\" and he could afford to be optimistic because Britain was now a stable, low-inflation economy and house prices were now stabilising. Mr Blair praised his chancellor for his role in creating economic stability, which he said was the \"cornerstone\" of Labour's programme.\\n\\nIn a speech at Edinburgh's Napier University, he said Labour would publish over the next few months \"a rich agenda for future policy in any possible third term\".\\n\\n\"In every area of work there is a detailed plan for the future, much clearer than those in 1997 or 2001. All of it fits together around common themes of opportunity, security and stability for all,\" Mr Blair said. In his pre-Budget report, Mr Brown surprised some City experts by forecasting UK growth at between 3% and 3.5% for next year. Many believe the figure is more likely to be under 3% - and fear tax rises or spending cuts, saying tax receipts have been overestimated. Carl Emmerson, from the Institute for Fiscal Studies, told BBC News: \"He thinks everything will come out in the wash and it will, in fact, be OK.

He is also head of the judiciary and a member of the Cabinet as constitutional affairs secretary.\\n\\nLady Boothroyd said she believed it was unacceptable for the lord chancellor to have the role of Speaker. \"I would really like to see a Speaker of the House of Lords,\" she said. \"I don't go for the idea of somebody - a lord chancellor - who is head of the judiciary, a senior Cabinet minister and Speaker of the Lords. \"I want somebody there who is going to look after that House and do a job there.\\n   \n",

He had decided to support the plans as the police said they would help fight terror, crime and illegal immigration. The Lib Dems have pledged to oppose the bill when it is debated next Monday.\\n\\nTory sources say senior party figures had argued vociferously against the ID card scheme. Among those reported to have serious reservations over the strategy were senior shadow cabinet members David Davis, Oliver Letwin and Tim Yeo. But Mr Howard denied Mr Yeo, his transport and environment spokesman, said the plans \"stink\". He also said he was confident shadow home secretary Mr Davis would \"set out the position very clearly\" when he stands up to debate the matter next week. Mr Howard said the police had said ID cards could \"help them foil a terror bomb plot in which people could lose their lives\". He added: \"When the police say that you have to take them seriously\".\\n\\nHe acknowledged there were \"good libertarian arguments\" against the cards, but said the shadow Cabinet had weighed up all the \"conflicting interests\" before reaching its decision. \"I don't pretend that it is an easy decision but at the end of the day a decision has to be taken.\" He also denied he was afraid of looking \"soft\" on the issue, compared to Labour. The Conservatives announced their support for the government plans on Monday evening.\\n\\nSources within the party told the BBC Mr Howard had always been in favour of ID cards, and tried to introduce them when he was Home Secretary. But the Tories insisted they would hold ministers to account over the precise purpose of the scheme.\\n\\nThey said they would also press Labour over whether objectives could be met and whether the Home Office would be able to deliver them. And they pledged to assess the cost effectiveness of ID cards and whether people's privacy would be properly protected. \"It is important to remember that this bill will take a decade to come into full effect,\" a spokesman said. Lib Dem home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten has branded the ID scheme a waste of money and \"deeply flawed\". He said: \"This has all the signs of Michael Howard overruling colleagues' concerns over ID cards.\"\\n\\nThe chairman of the Bar Council, Guy Mansfield QC warned there was a real risk that people on the \"margins of society\" would be driven into the hands of extremists. \"What is going to happen to young Asian men when there has been a bomb gone off somewhere? They are going to be stopped.

He had decided to support the plans as the police said they would help fight terror, crime and illegal immigration. The Lib Dems have pledged to oppose the bill when it is debated next Monday.\\n\\nTory sources say senior party figures had argued vociferously against the ID card scheme. Among those reported to have serious reservations over the strategy were senior shadow cabinet members David Davis, Oliver Letwin and Tim Yeo. But Mr Howard denied Mr Yeo, his transport and environment spokesman, said the plans \"stink\". He also said he was confident shadow home secretary Mr Davis would \"set out the position very clearly\" when he stands up to debate the matter next week. Mr Howard said the police had said ID cards could \"help them foil a terror bomb plot in which people could lose their lives\". He added: \"When the police say that you have to take them seriously\".\\n\\nHe acknowledged there were \"good libertarian arguments\" against the cards, but said the shadow Cabinet had weighed up all the \"conflicting interests\" before reaching its decision. \"I don't pretend that it is an easy decision but at the end of the day a decision has to be taken.\" He also denied he was afraid of looking \"soft\" on the issue, compared to Labour. The Conservatives announced their support for the government plans on Monday evening.\\n\\nSources within the party told the BBC Mr Howard had always been in favour of ID cards, and tried to introduce them when he was Home Secretary. But the Tories insisted they would hold ministers to account over the precise purpose of the scheme.\\n\\nThey said they would also press Labour over whether objectives could be met and whether the Home Office would be able to deliver them. And they pledged to assess the cost effectiveness of ID cards and whether people's privacy would be properly protected. \"It is important to remember that this bill will take a decade to come into full effect,\" a spokesman said. Lib Dem home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten has branded the ID scheme a waste of money and \"deeply flawed\". He said: \"This has all the signs of Michael Howard overruling colleagues' concerns over ID cards.\"\\n\\nThe chairman of the Bar Council, Guy Mansfield QC warned there was a real risk that people on the \"margins of society\" would be driven into the hands of extremists. \"What is going to happen to young Asian men when there has been a bomb gone off somewhere? They are going to be stopped.

Pupils in the schools taking part will learn the skills of speech writers, canvassers and political candidates. Schools Minister Stephen Twigg said engaging young people's interest was \"essential\" to the future of democracy.\\n\\nHe added: said \"Young people who are engaged and motivated by the political process are essential to the future health of our democracy. \"The mock elections initiative provides an opportunity for pupils to develop their own understanding of how the democratic process works and why it matters. \"By experiencing the election process first hand - from running a campaign to the declaration of the final result - we hope that young people will develop the enthusiasm to take part in the future.\" The Hansard Society, the Electoral Commission and the Department for Education and Skills are running the programme.

However, all sides are anxious to avoid a major confrontation in the run up to the general election, said BBC labour affairs correspondent Stephen Cape.

The Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS) will co-ordinate any industrial action with up to six other public sector unions. PCS leader Mark Serwotka warned last week that there could be further walkouts unless there was a government rethink. \"For a government that lectures everyone on choice - choice on public service, choice on this and choice on that - isn't it ironic that they're saying to public sector workers there is no choice,\" he said. \"If you want the pension you were promised when you started you must work for an extra five years - that is working until people drop. \"In the 20th century, it's completely unacceptable.\"\\n\\nUnison's 800,000 workers, the Transport and General Workers' Union's 70,000 and Amicus' 20,000 are among those being balloted about a 23 March walkout.

It would mean paid leave would be increased to nine months by 2007, Ms Hewitt told GMTV's Sunday programme. Other plans include letting maternity pay be given to fathers and extending rights to parents of older children. The Tories dismissed the maternity pay plan as \"desperate\", while the Liberal Democrats said it was misdirected. Ms Hewitt said: \"We have already doubled the length of maternity pay, it was 13 weeks when we were elected, we have already taken it up to 26 weeks. \"We are going to extend the pay to nine months by 2007 and the aim is to get it right up to the full 12 months by the end of the next Parliament.\" She said new mothers were already entitled to 12 months leave, but that many women could not take it as only six of those months were paid. \"We have made a firm commitment. We will definitely extend the maternity pay, from the six months where it now is to nine months, that's the extra 1,400.\" She said ministers would consult on other proposals that could see fathers being allowed to take some of their partner's maternity pay or leave period, or extending the rights of flexible working to carers or parents of older children. The Shadow Secretary of State for the Family, Theresa May, said: \"These plans were announced by Gordon Brown in his pre-budget review in December and Tony Blair is now recycling it in his desperate bid to win back women voters.\" She said the Conservatives would announce their proposals closer to the General Election. Liberal Democrat spokeswoman for women Sandra Gidley said: \"While mothers would welcome any extra maternity pay the Liberal Democrats feel this money is being misdirected.\" She said her party would boost maternity pay in the first six months to allow more women to stay at home in that time. Ms Hewitt also stressed the plans would be paid for by taxpayers, not employers. But David Frost, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, warned that many small firms could be \"crippled\" by the move. \"While the majority of any salary costs may be covered by the government's statutory pay, recruitment costs, advertising costs, retraining costs and the strain on the company will not be,\" he said. Further details of the government's plans will be outlined on Monday. New mothers are currently entitled to 90% of average earnings for the first six weeks after giving birth, followed by 102.80 a week until the baby is six months old.  \n",

Richard Thomas \"totally condemned\" the deletion of e-mails to prevent their disclosure under freedom of information laws coming into force on 1 January. Government guidance said e-mails should only be deleted if they served \"no current purpose\", Mr Thomas said. The Tories and the Lib Dems have questioned the timing of the new rules. Tory leader Michael Howard has written to Tony Blair demanding an explanation of the new rules on e-mail retention. On Monday Lib Dem constitutional affairs committee chairman Alan Beith warned that the deletion of millions of government e-mails could harm the ability of key probes like the Hutton Inquiry. The timing of the new rules just before the Freedom of Information Act comes into forces was \"too unlikely to have been a coincidence\", Mr Beith said. But a Cabinet Office spokeswoman said the move was not about the new laws or \"the destruction of important records\". Mr Beith urged the information commissioner to look at how the \"e-mail regime\" could \"support the freedom of information regime\". Mr Thomas said: \"The new Act of Parliament makes it very clear that to destroy records in order to prevent their disclosure becomes a criminal offence.\" He said there was already clear guidance on the retention of e-mails contained in a code of practice from the lord chancellor. All e-mails are subject to the freedom of information laws, but the important thing was the content of the e-mail, said Mr Thomas. \"If in doubt retain, that has been the long-standing principle of the civil service and public authorities. It's only when you've got no further use for the particular record that it may be legitimate to destroy it. \"But any deliberate destruction to avoid the possibility of later disclosure is to be totally condemned.\" The Freedom of Information Act will cover England, Wales and Northern Ireland from next year. Similar measures are being brought in at the same time in Scotland. It provides the public with a right of access to information held by about 100,000 public bodies, subject to various exemptions. Its implementation will be monitored by the information commissioner.  \n",
      "2  Hewitt decries 'career sexism' Plans to extend paid maternity leave beyond six months should be prominent in Labour's election manifesto, the Trade and Industry Secretary has said. Patricia Hewitt said the cost of the proposals was being evaluated, but it was an \"increasingly high priority\" and a \"shared goal across government\". Ms Hewitt was speaking at a gender and productivity seminar organised by the Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC). Mothers can currently take up to six months' paid leave - and six unpaid. Ms Hewitt told the seminar: \"Clearly, one of the things we need to do in the future is to extend the period of payment for maternity leave beyond the first six months into the second six months. \"We are looking at how quickly we can do that, because obviously there are cost implications because the taxpayer reimburses the employers for the cost of that.\" Ms Hewitt also announced a new drive to help women who want to work in male dominated sectors, saying sexism at work was still preventing women reaching their full potential. Plans include funding for universities to help female science and engineering graduates find jobs and \"taster courses\" for men and women in non-traditional jobs. Women in full-time work earn 19% less than men, according to the Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC). The minister told delegates that getting rid of \"career sexism\" was vital to closing the gender pay gap. \"Career sexism limits opportunities for women of all ages and prevents them from achieving their full potential. \"It is simply wrong to assume someone cannot do a job on the grounds of their sex,\" she said. Earlier, she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"What we are talking about here is the fact that about six out of 20 women work in jobs that are low-paid and typically dominated by women, so we have got very segregated employment. \"Unfortunately, in some cases, this reflects very old-fashioned and stereotypical ideas about the appropriate jobs for women, or indeed for men. \"Career sexism is about saying that engineering, for instance, where only 10% of employees are women, is really a male-dominated industry. Construction is even worse. \"But it is also about saying childcare jobs are really there for women and not suitable for men. Career sexism goes both ways.\" She added that while progress had been made, there was still a gap in pay figures. \"The average woman working full-time is being paid about 80p for every pound a man is earning. For women working part-time it is 60p.\" The Department for Trade and Industry will also provide funding to help a new pay experts panel run by the TUC. It has been set up to advise hundreds of companies on equal wage policies. Research conducted by the EOC last year revealed that many Britons believe the pay gap between men and women is the result of \"natural differences\" between the sexes. Women hold less than 10% of the top positions in FTSE 100 companies, the police, the judiciary and trade unions, according to their figures. And retired women have just over half the income of their male counterparts on average.  \n"

But David Frost, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, warned that many small firms could be \"crippled\" by the move. \"While the majority of any salary costs may be covered by the government's statutory pay, recruitment costs, advertising costs, retraining costs and the strain on the company will not be,\" he said.

         "Hewitt decries 'career sexism'\n\nPlans to extend paid maternity leave beyond six months should be prominent in Labour's election manifesto, the Trade and Industry Secretary has said.\n\nPatricia Hewitt said the cost of the proposals was being evaluated, but it was an \"increasingly high priority\" and a \"shared goal across government\". Ms Hewitt was speaking at a gender and productivity seminar organised by the Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC). Mothers can currently take up to six months' paid leave - and six unpaid. Ms Hewitt told the seminar: \"Clearly, one of the things we need to do in the future is to extend the period of payment for maternity leave beyond the first six months into the second six months. \"We are looking at how quickly we can do that, because obviously there are cost implications because the taxpayer reimburses the employers for the cost of that.\"\n\nMs Hewitt also announced a new drive to help women who want to work in male dominated sectors, saying sexism at work was still preventing women reaching their full potential. Plans include funding for universities to help female science and engineering graduates find jobs and \"taster courses\" for men and women in non-traditional jobs. Women in full-time work earn 19% less than men, according to the Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC).\n\nThe minister told delegates that getting rid of \"career sexism\" was vital to closing the gender pay gap.\n\n\"Career sexism limits opportunities for women of all ages and prevents them from achieving their full potential. \"It is simply wrong to assume someone cannot do a job on the grounds of their sex,\" she said. Earlier, she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"What we are talking about here is the fact that about six out of 20 women work in jobs that are low-paid and typically dominated by women, so we have got very segregated employment. \"Unfortunately, in some cases, this reflects very old-fashioned and stereotypical ideas about the appropriate jobs for women, or indeed for men. \"Career sexism is about saying that engineering, for instance, where only 10% of employees are women, is really a male-dominated industry. Construction is even worse. \"But it is also about saying childcare jobs are really there for women and not suitable for men. Career sexism goes both ways.\"\n\nShe added that while progress had been made, there was still a gap in pay figures. \"The average woman working full-time is being paid about 80p for every pound a man is earning. For women working part-time it is 60p.\" The Department for Trade and Industry will also provide funding to help a new pay experts panel run by the TUC.\n\nIt has been set up to advise hundreds of companies on equal wage policies. Research conducted by the EOC last year revealed that many Britons believe the pay gap between men and women is the result of \"natural differences\" between the sexes. Women hold less than 10% of the top positions in FTSE 100 companies, the police, the judiciary and trade unions, according to their figures. And retired women have just over half the income of their male counterparts on average.\n",

But Mr Balls, a prospective Labour MP, said he was confident the chancellor would meet his fiscal rules. He was speaking as Sir Digby Jones, CBI director general, warned Mr Brown not to be tempted to use any extra cash on pre-election bribes.\n\nMr Balls, who stepped down from his Treasury post to stand as a Labour candidate in the election, had suggested that Mr Brown would meet his golden economic rule - \"with a margin to spare\". He said he hoped more would be done to build on current tax credit rules.\n\nHe also stressed rise in interest rates ahead of an expected May election would not affect the Labour Party's chances of winning. Expectations of a rate rise have gathered pace after figures showed house prices are still rising. Consumer borrowing rose at a near-record pace in January. \"If the MPC (the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee) were to judge that a rate rise was justified before the election because of the strength of the economy - and I'm not predicting that they will - I do not believe that this will be a big election issue in Britain for Labour,\" he told a Parliamentary lunch. \"This is a big change in our political culture.\"\n\nDuring an interview with BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Balls said he was sure Mr Brown's Budget would not put at risk the stability of the economy. \"I don't think we'll see a pre-election spending spree - we certainly did not see that before 2001,\" he said.\n\nHis assurances came after Sir Digby Jones said stability was all important and any extra cash should be spent on improving workers' skills. His message to the chancellor was: \"Please don't give it away in any form of electioneering.\" Sir Digby added: \"I don't think he will. I have to say he has been a prudent chancellor right the way through. Stability is the key word - British business needs boring stability more than anything. \"We would say to him 'don't increase your public spending, don't give it away.

The timing of the new rules just before the Freedom of Information Act comes into forces was \"too unlikely to have been a coincidence\", Mr Beith said. But a Cabinet Office spokeswoman said the move was not about the new laws or \"the destruction of important records\". Mr Beith urged the information commissioner to look at how the \"e-mail regime\" could \"support the freedom of information regime\".\\n\\nMr Thomas said: \"The new Act of Parliament makes it very clear that to destroy records in order to prevent their disclosure becomes a criminal offence.\" He said there was already clear guidance on the retention of e-mails contained in a code of practice from the lord chancellor. All e-mails are subject to the freedom of information laws, but the important thing was the content of the e-mail, said Mr Thomas.\\n\\n\"If in doubt retain, that has been the long-standing principle of the civil service and public authorities. It's only when you've got no further use for the particular record that it may be legitimate to destroy it. \"But any deliberate destruction to avoid the possibility of later disclosure is to be totally condemned.\" The Freedom of Information Act will cover England, Wales and Northern Ireland from next year. Similar measures are being brought in at the same time in Scotland. It provides the public with a right of access to information held by about 100,000 public bodies, subject to various exemptions. Its implementation will be monitored by the information commissioner.\\n</td>\n",

       "      <td>Hewitt decries 'career sexism'\\n\\nPlans to extend paid maternity leave beyond six months should be prominent in Labour's election manifesto, the Trade and Industry Secretary has said.\\n\\nPatricia Hewitt said the cost of the proposals was being evaluated, but it was an \"increasingly high priority\" and a \"shared goal across government\". Ms Hewitt was speaking at a gender and productivity seminar organised by the Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC). Mothers can currently take up to six months' paid leave - and six unpaid. Ms Hewitt told the seminar: \"Clearly, one of the things we need to do in the future is to extend the period of payment for maternity leave beyond the first six months into the second six months. \"We are looking at how quickly we can do that, because obviously there are cost implications because the taxpayer reimburses the employers for the cost of that.\"\\n\\nMs Hewitt also announced a new drive to help women who want to work in male dominated sectors, saying sexism at work was still preventing women reaching their full potential. Plans include funding for universities to help female science and engineering graduates find jobs and \"taster courses\" for men and women in non-traditional jobs. Women in full-time work earn 19% less than men, according to the Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC).\\n\\nThe minister told delegates that getting rid of \"career sexism\" was vital to closing the gender pay gap.\\n\\n\"Career sexism limits opportunities for women of all ages and prevents them from achieving their full potential. \"It is simply wrong to assume someone cannot do a job on the grounds of their sex,\" she said. Earlier, she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"What we are talking about here is the fact that about six out of 20 women work in jobs that are low-paid and typically dominated by women, so we have got very segregated employment. \"Unfortunately, in some cases, this reflects very old-fashioned and stereotypical ideas about the appropriate jobs for women, or indeed for men. \"Career sexism is about saying that engineering, for instance, where only 10% of employees are women, is really a male-dominated industry. Construction is even worse. \"But it is also about saying childcare jobs are really there for women and not suitable for men. Career sexism goes both ways.\"\\n\\nShe added that while progress had been made, there was still a gap in pay figures. \"The average woman working full-time is being paid about 80p for every pound a man is earning. For women working part-time it is 60p.\" The Department for Trade and Industry will also provide funding to help a new pay experts panel run by the TUC.\\n\\nIt has been set up to advise hundreds of companies on equal wage policies. Research conducted by the EOC last year revealed that many Britons believe the pay gap between men and women is the result of \"natural differences\" between the sexes.

Other plans include letting maternity pay be given to fathers and extending rights to parents of older children. The Tories dismissed the maternity pay plan as \"desperate\", while the Liberal Democrats said it was misdirected.\\n\\nMs Hewitt said: \"We have already doubled the length of maternity pay, it was 13 weeks when we were elected, we have already taken it up to 26 weeks. \"We are going to extend the pay to nine months by 2007 and the aim is to get it right up to the full 12 months by the end of the next Parliament.\" She said new mothers were already entitled to 12 months leave, but that many women could not take it as only six of those months were paid. \"We have made a firm commitment. We will definitely extend the maternity pay, from the six months where it now is to nine months, that's the extra £1,400.\" She said ministers would consult on other proposals that could see fathers being allowed to take some of their partner's maternity pay or leave period, or extending the rights of flexible working to carers or parents of older children. The Shadow Secretary of State for the Family, Theresa May, said: \"These plans were announced by Gordon Brown in his pre-budget review in December and Tony Blair is now recycling it in his desperate bid to win back women voters.\"\\n\\nShe said the Conservatives would announce their proposals closer to the General Election. Liberal Democrat spokeswoman for women Sandra Gidley said: \"While mothers would welcome any extra maternity pay the Liberal Democrats feel this money is being misdirected.\" She said her party would boost maternity pay in the first six months to allow more women to stay at home in that time.\\n\\nMs Hewitt also stressed the plans would be paid for by taxpayers, not employers. But David Frost, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, warned that many small firms could be \"crippled\" by the move. \"While the majority of any salary costs may be covered by the government's statutory pay, recruitment costs, advertising costs, retraining costs and the strain on the company will not be,\" he said. Further details of the government's plans will be outlined on Monday. New mothers are currently entitled to 90% of average earnings for the first six weeks after giving birth, followed by £102.80 a week until the baby is six months old.\\n   \n",

Government guidance said e-mails should only be deleted if they served \"no current purpose\", Mr Thomas said. The Tories and the Lib Dems have questioned the timing of the new rules.\\n\\nTory leader Michael Howard has written to Tony Blair demanding an explanation of the new rules on e-mail retention. On Monday Lib Dem constitutional affairs committee chairman Alan Beith warned that the deletion of millions of government e-mails could harm the ability of key probes like the Hutton Inquiry. The timing of the new rules just before the Freedom of Information Act comes into forces was \"too unlikely to have been a coincidence\", Mr Beith said. But a Cabinet Office spokeswoman said the move was not about the new laws or \"the destruction of important records\". Mr Beith urged the information commissioner to look at how the \"e-mail regime\" could \"support the freedom of information regime\".\\n\\nMr Thomas said: \"The new Act of Parliament makes it very clear that to destroy records in order to prevent their disclosure becomes a criminal offence.\" He said there was already clear guidance on the retention of e-mails contained in a code of practice from the lord chancellor. All e-mails are subject to the freedom of information laws, but the important thing was the content of the e-mail, said Mr Thomas.\\n\\n\"If in doubt retain, that has been the long-standing principle of the civil service and public authorities. It's only when you've got no further use for the particular record that it may be legitimate to destroy it. \"But any deliberate destruction to avoid the possibility of later disclosure is to be totally condemned.\" The Freedom of Information Act will cover England, Wales and Northern Ireland from next year. Similar measures are being brought in at the same time in Scotland. It provides the public with a right of access to information held by about 100,000 public bodies, subject to various exemptions. Its implementation will be monitored by the information commissioner.\\n   \n",
       "2  Hewitt decries 'career sexism'\\n\\nPlans to extend paid maternity leave beyond six months should be prominent in Labour's election manifesto, the Trade and Industry Secretary has said.\\n\\nPatricia Hewitt said the cost of the proposals was being evaluated, but it was an \"increasingly high priority\" and a \"shared goal across government\". Ms Hewitt was speaking at a gender and productivity seminar organised by the Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC). Mothers can currently take up to six months' paid leave - and six unpaid. Ms Hewitt told the seminar: \"Clearly, one of the things we need to do in the future is to extend the period of payment for maternity leave beyond the first six months into the second six months. \"We are looking at how quickly we can do that, because obviously there are cost implications because the taxpayer reimburses the employers for the cost of that.\"\\n\\nMs Hewitt also announced a new drive to help women who want to work in male dominated sectors, saying sexism at work was still preventing women reaching their full potential. Plans include funding for universities to help female science and engineering graduates find jobs and \"taster courses\" for men and women in non-traditional jobs. Women in full-time work earn 19% less than men, according to the Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC).\\n\\nThe minister told delegates that getting rid of \"career sexism\" was vital to closing the gender pay gap.\\n\\n\"Career sexism limits opportunities for women of all ages and prevents them from achieving their full potential. \"It is simply wrong to assume someone cannot do a job on the grounds of their sex,\" she said. Earlier, she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"What we are talking about here is the fact that about six out of 20 women work in jobs that are low-paid and typically dominated by women, so we have got very segregated employment. \"Unfortunately, in some cases, this reflects very old-fashioned and stereotypical ideas about the appropriate jobs for women, or indeed for men. \"Career sexism is about saying that engineering, for instance, where only 10% of employees are women, is really a male-dominated industry. Construction is even worse. \"But it is also about saying childcare jobs are really there for women and not suitable for men. Career sexism goes both ways.\"\\n\\nShe added that while progress had been made, there was still a gap in pay figures. \"The average woman working full-time is being paid about 80p for every pound a man is earning. For women working part-time it is 60p.\" The Department for Trade and Industry will also provide funding to help a new pay experts panel run by the TUC.\\n\\nIt has been set up to advise hundreds of companies on equal wage policies. Research conducted by the EOC last year revealed that many Britons believe the pay gap between men and women is the result of \"natural differences\" between the sexes. Women hold less than 10% of the top positions in FTSE 100 companies, the police, the judiciary and trade unions, according to their figures. And retired women have just over half the income of their male counterparts on average.\\n   \n",

It will be the first time since 1917 that the party has chosen Manchester to host the annual event. Blackpool will get the much smaller February spring conference instead in what will be seen as a placatory move.\\n\\nFor years the main political parties have rotated between Blackpool, Bournemouth and Brighton. And the news the much larger annual conference is not to gather in Blackpool will be seen as a blow in the coastal resort. In 1998 the party said it would not return to Blackpool but did so in 2002. The following year Bournemouth hosted the event before the party signed a two year deal for Brighton to host the autumn conference.\\n\\nColin Asplin, Blackpool Hotel Association said: \"We have tried very hard to make sure they come back to Blackpool. \"Obviously we have failed in that. I just hope Manchester can handle the crowds. \"It amazes me that the Labour Party, which is a working class party, doesn't want to come to the main working class resort in the country.\" The exact cost to Blackpool in terms of lost revenue for hotel accommodation is not yet known but it is thought that block bookings will be taken at the major Manchester hotels after the official announcement.\\n   \n",

But Mr Balls, a prospective Labour MP, said he was confident the chancellor would meet his fiscal rules. He was speaking as Sir Digby Jones, CBI director general, warned Mr Brown not to be tempted to use any extra cash on pre-election bribes.\\n\\nMr Balls, who stepped down from his Treasury post to stand as a Labour candidate in the election, had suggested that Mr Brown would meet his golden economic rule - \"with a margin to spare\". He said he hoped more would be done to build on current tax credit rules.\\n\\nHe also stressed rise in interest rates ahead of an expected May election would not affect the Labour Party's chances of winning. Expectations of a rate rise have gathered pace after figures showed house prices are still rising. Consumer borrowing rose at a near-record pace in January. \"If the MPC (the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee) were to judge that a rate rise was justified before the election because of the strength of the economy - and I'm not predicting that they will - I do not believe that this will be a big election issue in Britain for Labour,\" he told a Parliamentary lunch. \"This is a big change in our political culture.\"\\n\\nDuring an interview with BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Balls said he was sure Mr Brown's Budget would not put at risk the stability of the economy. \"I don't think we'll see a pre-election spending spree - we certainly did not see that before 2001,\" he said.\\n\\nHis assurances came after Sir Digby Jones said stability was all important and any extra cash should be spent on improving workers' skills. His message to the chancellor was: \"Please don't give it away in any form of electioneering.\" Sir Digby added: \"I don't think he will. I have to say he has been a prudent chancellor right the way through. Stability is the key word - British business needs boring stability more than anything. \"We would say to him 'don't increase your public spending, don't give it away. But if you are going to anywhere, just add something to the competitiveness of Britain, put it into skilling our people'. \"That would be a good way to spend any excess.\"\\n\\nMr Balls refused to say whether Mr Brown would remain as chancellor after the election, amid speculation he will be offered the job of Foreign Secretary. \"I think that Gordon Brown wants to be part of the successful Labour government which delivers in the third term for the priorities of the people and sees off a Conservative Party that will take Britain backwards,\" Mr Balls told Today. Prime Minister Tony Blair has yet to name the date of the election, but most pundits are betting on 5 May.\\n   \n",

It would mean paid leave would be increased to nine months by 2007, Ms Hewitt told GMTV's Sunday programme. Other plans include letting maternity pay be given to fathers and extending rights to parents of older children. The Tories dismissed the maternity pay plan as \"desperate\", while the Liberal Democrats said it was misdirected. Ms Hewitt said: \"We have already doubled the length of maternity pay, it was 13 weeks when we were elected, we have already taken it up to 26 weeks. \"We are going to extend the pay to nine months by 2007 and the aim is to get it right up to the full 12 months by the end of the next Parliament.\" She said new mothers were already entitled to 12 months leave, but that many women could not take it as only six of those months were paid. \"We have made a firm commitment. We will definitely extend the maternity pay, from the six months where it now is to nine months, that's the extra 1,400.\" She said ministers would consult on other proposals that could see fathers being allowed to take some of their partner's maternity pay or leave period, or extending the rights of flexible working to carers or parents of older children. The Shadow Secretary of State for the Family, Theresa May, said: \"These plans were announced by Gordon Brown in his pre-budget review in December and Tony Blair is now recycling it in his desperate bid to win back women voters.\" She said the Conservatives would announce their proposals closer to the General Election. Liberal Democrat spokeswoman for women Sandra Gidley said: \"While mothers would welcome any extra maternity pay the Liberal Democrats feel this money is being misdirected.\" She said her party would boost maternity pay in the first six months to allow more women to stay at home in that time. Ms Hewitt also stressed the plans would be paid for by taxpayers, not employers. But David Frost, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, warned that many small firms could be \"crippled\" by the move. \"While the majority of any salary costs may be covered by the government's statutory pay, recruitment costs, advertising costs, retraining costs and the strain on the company will not be,\" he said. Further details of the government's plans will be outlined on Monday. New mothers are currently entitled to 90% of average earnings for the first six weeks after giving birth, followed by 102.80 a week until the baby is six months old.  \n",

Richard Thomas \"totally condemned\" the deletion of e-mails to prevent their disclosure under freedom of information laws coming into force on 1 January. Government guidance said e-mails should only be deleted if they served \"no current purpose\", Mr Thomas said. The Tories and the Lib Dems have questioned the timing of the new rules. Tory leader Michael Howard has written to Tony Blair demanding an explanation of the new rules on e-mail retention. On Monday Lib Dem constitutional affairs committee chairman Alan Beith warned that the deletion of millions of government e-mails could harm the ability of key probes like the Hutton Inquiry. The timing of the new rules just before the Freedom of Information Act comes into forces was \"too unlikely to have been a coincidence\", Mr Beith said. But a Cabinet Office spokeswoman said the move was not about the new laws or \"the destruction of important records\". Mr Beith urged the information commissioner to look at how the \"e-mail regime\" could \"support the freedom of information regime\". Mr Thomas said: \"The new Act of Parliament makes it very clear that to destroy records in order to prevent their disclosure becomes a criminal offence.\" He said there was already clear guidance on the retention of e-mails contained in a code of practice from the lord chancellor. All e-mails are subject to the freedom of information laws, but the important thing was the content of the e-mail, said Mr Thomas. \"If in doubt retain, that has been the long-standing principle of the civil service and public authorities. It's only when you've got no further use for the particular record that it may be legitimate to destroy it. \"But any deliberate destruction to avoid the possibility of later disclosure is to be totally condemned.\" The Freedom of Information Act will cover England, Wales and Northern Ireland from next year. Similar measures are being brought in at the same time in Scotland. It provides the public with a right of access to information held by about 100,000 public bodies, subject to various exemptions. Its implementation will be monitored by the information commissioner.  \n",
       "2  Hewitt decries 'career sexism' Plans to extend paid maternity leave beyond six months should be prominent in Labour's election manifesto, the Trade and Industry Secretary has said. Patricia Hewitt said the cost of the proposals was being evaluated, but it was an \"increasingly high priority\" and a \"shared goal across government\". Ms Hewitt was speaking at a gender and productivity seminar organised by the Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC). Mothers can currently take up to six months' paid leave - and six unpaid. Ms Hewitt told the seminar: \"Clearly, one of the things we need to do in the future is to extend the period of payment for maternity leave beyond the first six months into the second six months. \"We are looking at how quickly we can do that, because obviously there are cost implications because the taxpayer reimburses the employers for the cost of that.\" Ms Hewitt also announced a new drive to help women who want to work in male dominated sectors, saying sexism at work was still preventing women reaching their full potential. Plans include funding for universities to help female science and engineering graduates find jobs and \"taster courses\" for men and women in non-traditional jobs. Women in full-time work earn 19% less than men, according to the Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC). The minister told delegates that getting rid of \"career sexism\" was vital to closing the gender pay gap. \"Career sexism limits opportunities for women of all ages and prevents them from achieving their full potential. \"It is simply wrong to assume someone cannot do a job on the grounds of their sex,\" she said. Earlier, she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"What we are talking about here is the fact that about six out of 20 women work in jobs that are low-paid and typically dominated by women, so we have got very segregated employment. \"Unfortunately, in some cases, this reflects very old-fashioned and stereotypical ideas about the appropriate jobs for women, or indeed for men. \"Career sexism is about saying that engineering, for instance, where only 10% of employees are women, is really a male-dominated industry. Construction is even worse. \"But it is also about saying childcare jobs are really there for women and not suitable for men. Career sexism goes both ways.\" She added that while progress had been made, there was still a gap in pay figures. \"The average woman working full-time is being paid about 80p for every pound a man is earning. For women working part-time it is 60p.\" The Department for Trade and Industry will also provide funding to help a new pay experts panel run by the TUC. It has been set up to advise hundreds of companies on equal wage policies. Research conducted by the EOC last year revealed that many Britons believe the pay gap between men and women is the result of \"natural differences\" between the sexes. Women hold less than 10% of the top positions in FTSE 100 companies, the police, the judiciary and trade unions, according to their figures. And retired women have just over half the income of their male counterparts on average.  \n",

The much trailed decision was ratified by Labour's ruling National Executive Committee in a break with the traditional choice of a seaside venue. It will be the first time since 1917 that the party has chosen Manchester to host the annual event. Blackpool will get the much smaller February spring conference instead in what will be seen as a placatory move. For years the main political parties have rotated between Blackpool, Bournemouth and Brighton. And the news the much larger annual conference is not to gather in Blackpool will be seen as a blow in the coastal resort. In 1998 the party said it would not return to Blackpool but did so in 2002. The following year Bournemouth hosted the event before the party signed a two year deal for Brighton to host the autumn conference. Colin Asplin, Blackpool Hotel Association said: \"We have tried very hard to make sure they come back to Blackpool. \"Obviously we have failed in that. I just hope Manchester can handle the crowds. \"It amazes me that the Labour Party, which is a working class party, doesn't want to come to the main working class resort in the country.\" The exact cost to Blackpool in terms of lost revenue for hotel accommodation is not yet known but it is thought that block bookings will be taken at the major Manchester hotels after the official announcement.  \n",

Ed Balls, ex-chief economic adviser to the Treasury, said there would be no spending spree before polling day. But Mr Balls, a prospective Labour MP, said he was confident the chancellor would meet his fiscal rules. He was speaking as Sir Digby Jones, CBI director general, warned Mr Brown not to be tempted to use any extra cash on pre-election bribes. Mr Balls, who stepped down from his Treasury post to stand as a Labour candidate in the election, had suggested that Mr Brown would meet his golden economic rule - \"with a margin to spare\". He said he hoped more would be done to build on current tax credit rules. He also stressed rise in interest rates ahead of an expected May election would not affect the Labour Party's chances of winning. Expectations of a rate rise have gathered pace after figures showed house prices are still rising. Consumer borrowing rose at a near-record pace in January. \"If the MPC (the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee) were to judge that a rate rise was justified before the election because of the strength of the economy - and I'm not predicting that they will - I do not believe that this will be a big election issue in Britain for Labour,\" he told a Parliamentary lunch. \"This is a big change in our political culture.\" During an interview with BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Balls said he was sure Mr Brown's Budget would not put at risk the stability of the economy. \"I don't think we'll see a pre-election spending spree - we certainly did not see that before 2001,\" he said. His assurances came after Sir Digby Jones said stability was all important and any extra cash should be spent on improving workers' skills. His message to the chancellor was: \"Please don't give it away in any form of electioneering.\" Sir Digby added: \"I don't think he will. I have to say he has been a prudent chancellor right the way through. Stability is the key word - British business needs boring stability more than anything. \"We would say to him 'don't increase your public spending, don't give it away. But if you are going to anywhere, just add something to the competitiveness of Britain, put it into skilling our people'. \"That would be a good way to spend any excess.\" Mr Balls refused to say whether Mr Brown would remain as chancellor after the election, amid speculation he will be offered the job of Foreign Secretary. \"I think that Gordon Brown wants to be part of the successful Labour government which delivers in the third term for the priorities of the people and sees off a Conservative Party that will take Britain backwards,\" Mr Balls told Today. Prime Minister Tony Blair has yet to name the date of the election, but most pundits are betting on 5 May.  "

It would mean paid leave would be increased to nine months by 2007, Ms Hewitt told GMTV's Sunday programme. Other plans include letting maternity pay be given to fathers and extending rights to parents of older children. The Tories dismissed the maternity pay plan as \"desperate\", while the Liberal Democrats said it was misdirected. Ms Hewitt said: \"We have already doubled the length of maternity pay, it was 13 weeks when we were elected, we have already taken it up to 26 weeks. \"We are going to extend the pay to nine months by 2007 and the aim is to get it right up to the full 12 months by the end of the next Parliament.\" She said new mothers were already entitled to 12 months leave, but that many women could not take it as only six of those months were paid. \"We have made a firm commitment. We will definitely extend the maternity pay, from the six months where it now is to nine months, that's the extra 1,400.\" She said ministers would consult on other proposals that could see fathers being allowed to take some of their partner's maternity pay or leave period, or extending the rights of flexible working to carers or parents of older children. The Shadow Secretary of State for the Family, Theresa May, said: \"These plans were announced by Gordon Brown in his pre-budget review in December and Tony Blair is now recycling it in his desperate bid to win back women voters.\" She said the Conservatives would announce their proposals closer to the General Election. Liberal Democrat spokeswoman for women Sandra Gidley said: \"While mothers would welcome any extra maternity pay the Liberal Democrats feel this money is being misdirected.\" She said her party would boost maternity pay in the first six months to allow more women to stay at home in that time. Ms Hewitt also stressed the plans would be paid for by taxpayers, not employers. But David Frost, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, warned that many small firms could be \"crippled\" by the move. \"While the majority of any salary costs may be covered by the government's statutory pay, recruitment costs, advertising costs, retraining costs and the strain on the company will not be,\" he said. Further details of the government's plans will be outlined on Monday. New mothers are currently entitled to 90% of average earnings for the first six weeks after giving birth, followed by 102.80 a week until the baby is six months old.  \n",

Richard Thomas \"totally condemned\" the deletion of e-mails to prevent their disclosure under freedom of information laws coming into force on 1 January. Government guidance said e-mails should only be deleted if they served \"no current purpose\", Mr Thomas said. The Tories and the Lib Dems have questioned the timing of the new rules. Tory leader Michael Howard has written to Tony Blair demanding an explanation of the new rules on e-mail retention. On Monday Lib Dem constitutional affairs committee chairman Alan Beith warned that the deletion of millions of government e-mails could harm the ability of key probes like the Hutton Inquiry. The timing of the new rules just before the Freedom of Information Act comes into forces was \"too unlikely to have been a coincidence\", Mr Beith said. But a Cabinet Office spokeswoman said the move was not about the new laws or \"the destruction of important records\". Mr Beith urged the information commissioner to look at how the \"e-mail regime\" could \"support the freedom of information regime\". Mr Thomas said: \"The new Act of Parliament makes it very clear that to destroy records in order to prevent their disclosure becomes a criminal offence.\" He said there was already clear guidance on the retention of e-mails contained in a code of practice from the lord chancellor. All e-mails are subject to the freedom of information laws, but the important thing was the content of the e-mail, said Mr Thomas. \"If in doubt retain, that has been the long-standing principle of the civil service and public authorities. It's only when you've got no further use for the particular record that it may be legitimate to destroy it. \"But any deliberate destruction to avoid the possibility of later disclosure is to be totally condemned.\" The Freedom of Information Act will cover England, Wales and Northern Ireland from next year. Similar measures are being brought in at the same time in Scotland. It provides the public with a right of access to information held by about 100,000 public bodies, subject to various exemptions. Its implementation will be monitored by the information commissioner.  \n",

Patricia Hewitt said the cost of the proposals was being evaluated, but it was an \"increasingly high priority\" and a \"shared goal across government\". Ms Hewitt was speaking at a gender and productivity seminar organised by the Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC). Mothers can currently take up to six months' paid leave - and six unpaid. Ms Hewitt told the seminar: \"Clearly, one of the things we need to do in the future is to extend the period of payment for maternity leave beyond the first six months into the second six months. \"We are looking at how quickly we can do that, because obviously there are cost implications because the taxpayer reimburses the employers for the cost of that.\" Ms Hewitt also announced a new drive to help women who want to work in male dominated sectors, saying sexism at work was still preventing women reaching their full potential. Plans include funding for universities to help female science and engineering graduates find jobs and \"taster courses\" for men and women in non-traditional jobs. Women in full-time work earn 19% less than men, according to the Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC). The minister told delegates that getting rid of \"career sexism\" was vital to closing the gender pay gap. \"Career sexism limits opportunities for women of all ages and prevents them from achieving their full potential. \"It is simply wrong to assume someone cannot do a job on the grounds of their sex,\" she said. Earlier, she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"What we are talking about here is the fact that about six out of 20 women work in jobs that are low-paid and typically dominated by women, so we have got very segregated employment. \"Unfortunately, in some cases, this reflects very old-fashioned and stereotypical ideas about the appropriate jobs for women, or indeed for men. \"Career sexism is about saying that engineering, for instance, where only 10% of employees are women, is really a male-dominated industry. Construction is even worse. \"But it is also about saying childcare jobs are really there for women and not suitable for men. Career sexism goes both ways.\" She added that while progress had been made, there was still a gap in pay figures. \"The average woman working full-time is being paid about 80p for every pound a man is earning. For women working part-time it is 60p.\" The Department for Trade and Industry will also provide funding to help a new pay experts panel run by the TUC. It has been set up to advise hundreds of companies on equal wage policies. Research conducted by the EOC last year revealed that many Britons believe the pay gap between men and women is the result of \"natural differences\" between the sexes. Women hold less than 10% of the top positions in FTSE 100 companies, the police, the judiciary and trade unions, according to their figures. And retired women have just over half the income of their male counterparts on average.  \n",

The much trailed decision was ratified by Labour's ruling National Executive Committee in a break with the traditional choice of a seaside venue. It will be the first time since 1917 that the party has chosen Manchester to host the annual event. Blackpool will get the much smaller February spring conference instead in what will be seen as a placatory move. For years the main political parties have rotated between Blackpool, Bournemouth and Brighton. And the news the much larger annual conference is not to gather in Blackpool will be seen as a blow in the coastal resort. In 1998 the party said it would not return to Blackpool but did so in 2002. The following year Bournemouth hosted the event before the party signed a two year deal for Brighton to host the autumn conference. Colin Asplin, Blackpool Hotel Association said: \"We have tried very hard to make sure they come back to Blackpool. \"Obviously we have failed in that. I just hope Manchester can handle the crowds. \"It amazes me that the Labour Party, which is a working class party, doesn't want to come to the main working class resort in the country.\" The exact cost to Blackpool in terms of lost revenue for hotel accommodation is not yet known but it is thought that block bookings will be taken at the major Manchester hotels after the official announcement.  \n",

Ed Balls, ex-chief economic adviser to the Treasury, said there would be no spending spree before polling day. But Mr Balls, a prospective Labour MP, said he was confident the chancellor would meet his fiscal rules. He was speaking as Sir Digby Jones, CBI director general, warned Mr Brown not to be tempted to use any extra cash on pre-election bribes. Mr Balls, who stepped down from his Treasury post to stand as a Labour candidate in the election, had suggested that Mr Brown would meet his golden economic rule - \"with a margin to spare\". He said he hoped more would be done to build on current tax credit rules. He also stressed rise in interest rates ahead of an expected May election would not affect the Labour Party's chances of winning. Expectations of a rate rise have gathered pace after figures showed house prices are still rising. Consumer borrowing rose at a near-record pace in January. \"If the MPC (the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee) were to judge that a rate rise was justified before the election because of the strength of the economy - and I'm not predicting that they will - I do not believe that this will be a big election issue in Britain for Labour,\" he told a Parliamentary lunch. \"This is a big change in our political culture.\" During an interview with BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Balls said he was sure Mr Brown's Budget would not put at risk the stability of the economy. \"I don't think we'll see a pre-election spending spree - we certainly did not see that before 2001,\" he said. His assurances came after Sir Digby Jones said stability was all important and any extra cash should be spent on improving workers' skills. His message to the chancellor was: \"Please don't give it away in any form of electioneering.\" Sir Digby added: \"I don't think he will. I have to say he has been a prudent chancellor right the way through. Stability is the key word - British business needs boring stability more than anything. \"We would say to him 'don't increase your public spending, don't give it away. But if you are going to anywhere, just add something to the competitiveness of Britain, put it into skilling our people'. \"That would be a good way to spend any excess.\" Mr Balls refused to say whether Mr Brown would remain as chancellor after the election, amid speculation he will be offered the job of Foreign Secretary. \"I think that Gordon Brown wants to be part of the successful Labour government which delivers in the third term for the priorities of the people and sees off a Conservative Party that will take Britain backwards,\" Mr Balls told Today. Prime Minister Tony Blair has yet to name the date of the election, but most pundits are betting on 5 May.  \n",

The report said too many parties were involved in decision-making when the attraction first went on sale after the Millennium exhibition ended. The National Audit Office said the Dome cost taxpayers 28.7m to maintain and sell in the four years after it closed. Finally, a deal to turn it into a sport and entertainment venue was struck. More than 550m could now be returned to the public sector in the wake of the deal to regenerate the site in Greenwich, London. The NAO report said that this sale went through because it avoided many of the problems of the previous attempt to sell the Dome. Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott said a good deal had been secured. \"Delivery of the many benefits secured through this deal will continue the substantial progress already made at the Millennium Village and elsewhere on the peninsula,\" he said. But Edward Leigh, who is chairman of the Commons public accounts committee, warned the government would have to work hard to ensure taxpayers would get full benefit from the Dome deal. He said: \"This report also shows that the first attempt to sell the Dome proved a complete fiasco. Every arm of government seems to have had a finger in the pie. The process was confused and muddled.\" He added: \"Four years after the Millennium Exhibition closed, the Government finally has a deal to find a use for what has been a white elephant since it closed in a deal that, incredible as it may seem, should bring in some money and provide a benefit for the local area and the country as whole. However, it was more a question of luck that a strong bid turned up after thefirst abortive attempt.\" NAO head Sir John Bourn said: \"In difficult circumstances following the failure of the first competition, English Partnerships and the office of the deputy prime minister have worked hard to get a deal.\"  \n",

Tory co-chairman Liam Fox was speaking after Mr Blair told Labour members the Tories offered a \"hard right agenda\". Dr Fox told BBC Radio: \"If you are willing to lie about the reasons for going to war, I guess you are going to lie about anything at all.\" He would not discuss reports the party repaid 500,000 to Lord Ashcroft after he predicted an election defeat. The prime minister ratcheted up Labour's pre-election campaigning at the weekend with a helicopter tour of the country and his speech at the party's spring conference. He insisted he did not know the poll date, but it is widely expected to be 5 May. In what was seen as a highly personal speech in Gateshead on Sunday, Mr Blair said: \"I have the same passion and hunger as when I first walked through the door of 10 Downing Street.\" He described his relationship with the public as starting euphoric, then struggling to live up to the expectations, and reaching the point of raised voices and \"throwing crockery\". He warned his supporters against complacency, saying: \"It's a fight for the future of our country, it's a fight that for Britain and the people of Britain we have to win.\" Mr Blair said that whether the public chose Michael Howard or Mr Kennedy, it would result in \"a Tory government not a Labour government and a country that goes back and does not move forward\". Dr Fox accused Mr Blair and other Cabinet ministers of telling lies about their opponents' policies and then attacking the lies. \"What we learned at the weekend is what Labour tactics are going to be and it's going to be fear and smear,\" he told BBC News. The Tory co-chairman attacked Labour's six new pledges as \"vacuous\" and said Mr Blair was very worried voters would take revenge for his failure to deliver. Dr Fox refused to discuss weekend newspaper reports that the party had repaid 500,000 to former Tory Treasurer Lord Ashcroft after he said the party could not win the election. \"We repay loans when they are due but do not comment to individual financial matters,\" he said, insisting he enjoyed a \"warm and constructive\" relationship to Lord Ashcroft. Meanwhile Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy is expected to attack Mr Blair's words as he begins a nationwide tour on Monday. Mr Kennedy is accelerating Lib Dem election preparations this week as he visits Manchester, Liverpool, Leicester, Somerset, Basingstoke, Shrewsbury, Dorset and Torbay. He said: \"This is three-party politics. In the northern cities, the contest is between Labour and the Liberal Democrats. \"In southern and rural seats - especially in the South West - the principal contenders are the Liberal Democrats and the Conservatives, who are out of the running in Scotland and Wales.\" The Lib Dems accuse Mr Blair of making a \"touchy-feely\" speech to Labour delegates which will not help him regain public trust.  \n",
      "7                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Women MPs reveal sexist taunts Women MPs endure \"shocking\" levels of sexist abuse at the hands of their male counterparts, a new study shows. Male MPs pretended to juggle imaginary breasts and jeered \"melons\" as women made Commons speeches, researchers from Birkbeck College were told. Labour's Yvette Cooper said she found it hard to persuade Commons officials she was a minister and not a secretary. Some 83 MPs gave their answers in 100 hours of taped interviews for the study \"Whose Secretary are You, minister\". The research team, under Professor Joni Lovenduski, had set out to look at the achievements and experiences of women at Westminster. But what emerged was complaints from MPs of all parties of sexist barracking in the Chamber, sexist insults and patronising assumptions about their abilities. Barbara Follet, one of the so-called \"Blair Babes\" elected in 1997, told researchers: \"I remember some Conservatives - whenever a Labour woman got up to speak they would take their breasts - imaginary breasts - in their hands and wiggle them and say 'melons' as we spoke.\" Former Liberal Democrat MP Jackie Ballard recalled a stream of remarks from a leading MP on topics such as women's legs or their sexual persuasion. And ex-Tory education secretary Gillian Shepherd remembered how one of her male colleagues called all women \"Betty\". \"When I said, 'Look you know my name isn't Betty', he said, 'ah but you're all the same, so I call you all Betty'.\" Harriet Harman told researchers of the sheer hostility prompted by her advancement to the Cabinet: \"Well, you've only succeeded because you're a woman.\" Another current member of the Cabinet says she was told: \"Oh, you've had a very fast rise, who have you been sleeping with?\" Even after the great influx of women MPs at the 1997 general election, and greater numbers of women in the Cabinet, female MPs often say they feel stuck on the edge of a male world. Liberal Democrat Sarah Teather, the most recent female MP to be elected, told researchers: \"Lots of people say it's like an old boys club. \"I've always said to me it feels more like a teenage public school - you know a public school full of teenagers.\" Prof Joni Lovenduski, who conducted the study with the help of Margaret Moran MP and a team of journalists, said she was shocked at the findings. \"We expected a bit of this but nothing like this extent. We expected to find a couple of shocking episodes.\" But she said there was a difference between the experiences of women before the 1997 intake and afterwards. This was mainly because there were more women present in Parliament who were not prepared to \"put up with\" the sexist attitudes they came across, Prof Lovenduski said. But she added: \"Some women, including the women who came in 1997, received extraordinary treatment and I am not convinced that if the number of women changed back to what it was before 1997 that things would not change back. \"What I think is shocking to the general public is that these things go on in the House of Commons.\" The interviews are to be placed in the British Library as a historical record.  \n",
      "8                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Campbell: E-mail row 'silly fuss' Ex-No 10 media chief Alastair Campbell is at the centre of a new political row over an e-mail containing a four-letter outburst aimed at BBC journalists. Mr Campbell sent the missive by mistake to BBC2's Newsnight after it sought to question his role in Labour's controversial poster campaign. He later contacted the show saying the original e-mail had been sent in error and that it was all a \"silly fuss\". Mr Campbell has recently re-joined Labour's election campaign. The e-mail was revealed the day after Peter Mandelson, former Labour minister and now a European Commissioner, warned the BBC to steer away from \"demonising\" Mr Campbell. Mr Campbell messaged Newsnight after the programme investigated claims that Labour's advertising agency TBWA was blaming him for controversy over its campaign posters. The images, including one of flying pigs and another of what critics claim depicted Tory leader Michael Howard as Fagin, prompted accusations of anti-Semitism, claims denied by Labour. Mr Campbell's e-mail, which was apparently intended for a party official, suggested they should get Trevor Beattie, TBWA's boss, to issue a statement. In it, he said: \"Just spoke to trev. think tbwa shd give statement to newsnight saying party and agency work together well and nobody here has spoken to standard. Posters done by by tbwa according to political brief. Now fuck off and cover something important you twats!\" The e-mail was sent by mistake to Newsnight journalist Andrew McFadyen. Realising his error, Mr Campbell then e-mailed Mr McFadyen pointing out the mistake, but suggesting presenter Jeremy Paxman would have seen the funny side. He said: \"Not very good at this e-mail Blackberry malarkey. Just looked at log of sent messages, have realised e-mail meant for colleagues at TBWA has gone to you. For the record, first three sentences of email spot on. No row between me and trevor. \"Posters done by them according to our brief. I dreamt up flying pigs. Pigs not great but okay in the circs of Tories promising tax cuts and spending rises with the same money. TBWA made production. \"Campbell swears shock. Final sentence of earlier e-mail probably a bit colourful and personal considering we have never actually met but I'm sure you share the same sense of humour as your star presenter Mr P. \"Never known such a silly fuss since the last silly fuss but there we go. Must look forward not back.\" Later the prime minister's spokesman was asked by journalists about his view on Mr Campbell's use of abusive language. The spokesman said: \"The person you are referring to is capable of speaking for himself and he no longer works in government.\" Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said he had always had \"very good and polite relations\" with Mr Campbell, who he described as \"very talented\". But on the former spin doctor's use of language, Mr Straw said: \"I do know the odd journalist who has occasionally used the odd word that would probably be inappropriate in some circumstances. Maybe I mix with the wrong kind of journalists.\" Liam Fox, Tory co-chairman, said the return of Mr Campbell was a sign of new \"sinister and underhand tactics\" by Labour.  \n",

The government has plans for up to eight Las Vegas style resorts in the UK, one of which is likely to be in Glasgow. Scottish ministers insist they will still have the final say on whether a super-casino will be built in Scotland. But opposition parties say that will not happen in practice. The vote is due to be taken on Wednesday and is expected to be close. The Scottish Executive believes that the legislation should be handled by Westminster. The new law will control internet gambling for the first time and is aimed at preventing children from becoming involved. A super-casino in Glasgow could be located at Ibrox or the Scottish Exhibition and Conference Centre. The new gambling bill going through Westminster will allow casino complexes to open to the public, have live entertainment and large numbers of fruit machines with unlimited prizes. But the Scottish National Party and the Tories say the issue of super-casinos should be decided in Scotland and believe the executive is shirking its responsibility.  \n",

Mrs Howard will make solo visits to target seats as well as accompanying her husband on his helicopter campaign trail criss-crossing the country. Mr Howard will host a news conference at the party's London HQ every morning, Tory co-chairman Liam Fox said. \"We want Michael to be as accessible as possible,\" Mr Fox said, adding that the party was not afraid of scrutiny. The Tory leader wanted to meet as many ordinary members of the public, Mr Fox said. Tony Blair has also said he is intending to get out and talk to as many people as possible during the election campaign. But Labour campaign chiefs say there are no plans for Mr Blair to hold a daily news conference. Mr Fox responded by accusing the prime minister of \"hiding away from the scrutiny of London's media\". The Liberal Democrats also say they are planning to hold daily news conferences with Charles Kennedy. On Mrs Howard's role, Mr Fox said: \"Sandra has already been campaigning with Michael on a number of visits and has been undertaking short visits herself. \"That pattern will continue. It's worked very well up until now.\" Mrs Howard made her debut speech at the Conservative Party Conference in Bournemouth last October. She used her speech on the fringe to highlight the work of a drugs charity, Addaction, which she supports. Mrs Howard has also appeared along side her husband on TV chat shows. During an interview on ITV1's This Morning she said she often criticised her husband for not showing the side of him that she knows.  \n",

The prime minister was commenting on the wrongful jailing of 11 people for IRA bomb attacks on pubs in Guildford and Woolwich in 1974. Mr Blair said: \"I am very sorry that they were subject to such an ordeal and injustice.\" He made the apology to members of the Conlon and Maguire families in his private room at Westminster. In a statement recorded for television, Mr Blair said the families deserved \"to be completely and publicly exonerated\". The families had hoped the apology would be made during Prime Minister's Questions in the House of Commons. However, one of the so-called Guildford Four, Gerry Conlon - who was wrongly convicted of planting the bombs - said the families were delighted with the apology. He said Mr Blair had spoken with \"such sincerity\", adding: \"He went beyond what we thought he would, he took time to listen to everyone. \"You could see he was moved by what people were saying. \"Tony Blair has healed rifts, he is helping to heal wounds. It's a day I never thought would come.\" The move followed a huge campaign in Ireland for a public apology after eleven people were wrongly convicted of making and planting the IRA bombs which killed seven people. Mr Blair's official spokesman said no-one present at the meeting would \"ever forget the strength of feeling of relief that the prime minister's statement brought to them\". Most of those convicted were either members or friends of the two families. All were arrested because of a family connection to Gerry Conlon. Mr Conlon's father Giuseppe was arrested when travelling to London from Belfast to help his son. He died while serving his sentence. Also arrested were Anne Maguire and members of her family. Mrs Maguire was the relative with whom Giuseppe planned to stay in London, as well as two family friends. She said it was a \"wonderful feeling\" to have had the apology and that a weight had been lifted off her shoulders. \"The people who were still doubting us should now believe that we were totally innocent,\" she said. They were all jailed for handling explosives, based on scientific evidence which was later entirely discredited. In October 1989 the Court of Appeal quashed the sentences of the Guildford Four, and in June 1991 it overturned the sentences on the Maguire Seven. Mr Conlon's case was highlighted in the Oscar-nominated film In The Name Of The Father, starring Daniel Day-Lewis.  \n",

Mr Howard, whose parents fled the Nazi threat to come to the UK, says the claim would mean no-one from an immigrant family could become premier. His comments come in a BBC documentary called 'No More Mr Nasty'. TV presenter Anne Robinson said as home secretary he gave the impression he would \"like to kick your cat\". Ms Robinson, a friend of the Tory leader, also revealed that as a Cambridge student Mr Howard was \"much loved by women and he was a courteous and kind and rather dashing lover\" - although she denied having personal experience. \"I wasn't at Cambridge - and it's not personal experience - but I know people who were.\" Documentary maker Michael Cockerell was given behind-the-scenes access to Mr Howard for his film portrait. The Tory leader was asked about to respond to people who said that if there had there been a quota on immigration and asylum in the 1930s, his parents might not have been allowed into the country. He replies: \"What is the inference of that? \"That if you reach the view that you need to control immigration in the interests of the country you're not allowed to put a view forward if you happen to be descended from immigrants? \"That seems to me an absolutely extraordinary proposition? It would certainly mean no one from immigrant parents could be prime minister.\" Ms Robinson, who presents The Weakest Link tells Cockerell that she despaired at his hardline image when he was home secretary in John Major's government. \"I used to have to sit on my hands because he'd get on television and give a passable impression of someone who'd like to kick your cat or would put your baby in prison if he cried. I mean it was very, very Draconian.\" The film shows Mr Howard laughing at Rory Bremner's impression of him as Dracula, which he calls \"good fun\", apart from the serious falsehood of a comment suggesting he wants fewer black people in the UK. The film shows the private side of the Tory leader watching television at home or playing table tennis with his wife, ex-model Sandra. Asked if she enjoys a game of ping pong she confesses: \"Yeah, it would be more enjoyable if I could win occasionally too, but otherwise it's quite fun.\" Former Downing Street communications chief Alastair Campbell, now working on Labour's election campaign, says a \"touchy-feely\" image does not fit Mr Howard. He says Tony Blair was not worried by his opponents' early performance in their Commons clashes because Mr Howard lacked a \"big strategy\", including on issues like Iraq. The Tory leader brands such criticisms as \"absolutely rubbish\", arguing that he has been consistent on his support for the war but critical of Mr Blair's failure to tell the truth on intelligence. Former Tory chancellor Ken Clarke says Mr Howard has a bigger problem changing perceptions of the Tory party than his personal image. Mr Clarke says the party is improving and it is \"conceivable\" it could win the next election. But he adds: \"It has got to change itself a bit and broaden its appeal.\" - Michael Howard: No More Mr Nasty is being shown on BBC2 on Saturday 12 February at 2005 GMT.  \n",

The Tories wanted a sunset clause inserted in the Anti-Terrorism Bill that would have forced ministers to revisit it in November. Mr Blair said the bill, which brings in house arrest for terror suspects, had time limiting safeguards already. The Tories say they will vote against it unless changes they want are agreed. The Lib Dems also oppose the plans. The government has already given way over the role of judges in house arrest cases. Mr Blair's refusal to accept the Tories' sunset clause proposals means that the government faces concerted opposition from all sides in the Lords. Peers begin three days of detailed deliberation on the bill on Thursday. The bill proposes \"control orders\", which as well as placing terrorism suspects under house arrest could mean curfews, tagging or bans on telephone and internet use. These would replace current powers to detain foreign terror suspects without trial, which the law lords have ruled against as a breach of human rights. The Tories want judicial oversight of all control orders, not just house arrest. Shadow Home Secretary David Davis told BBC Radio Four's the World at One his primary concern was potential miscarriages of justice. He said if someone was wrongly given a control order it would act as a \"recruiting sergeant\" for terrorists. He went on to say: \"If we don't get the amendments we regard as essential, including the sunset clause, we will vote against the bill.\" In the Commons, Mr Howard said it would be \"far better if the whole of the legislation was subject to a sunset clause so Parliament could consider it all in a proper way instead of it being ramrodded through\". Mr Blair said the house arrest powers were already going to be subject to a sunset clause because it was annually renewable. The second, less stringent, type of control orders would be subject to a court appeal within 14 days and there would be a three-monthly report on their use by \"an eminent and independent person\". \"I believe (the new powers) are a proper balance between the civil liberties of the subject and the necessary national security of this country that I will not put at risk,\" said Mr Blair. The Lib Dems plan to oppose the Bill in the Lords on Thursday. Lib Dem home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten said: \"There's a lot of talking left. I would be uneasy about supporting a very bad bill even if it was just for eight months.\" A spokeswoman for Human Rights Watch said it was a \"basic principle\" that people should only be punished after a fair trial. She added: \"Having a judge impose those punishments without a trial does not sanitise them either.\"  \n",

Officials at the two-day summit at the foreign secretary's official Kent house, Chevening, will plan a new forum on the Rock's future. In October, Mr Straw and his Spanish counterpart Miguel Moratinos agreed to establish a body that would give Gibraltarians a voice in their future. Most Gibraltarians said in a referendum they wanted to remain British. Gibraltar's Chief Minister Peter Caruana will represent the British citizens living on the Rock, while Britain's Europe Director Dominick Chilcott will represent the UK. Madrid is being represented by Spain's director general for Europe, Jose Maria Pons. The initiative follows Spain's socialist government's decision to put its long-standing sovereignty ambitions on hold. Gibraltarians rejected plans for the Rock's sovereignty to be shared between Britain and Spain in a referendum organised by Gibraltar government.  \n",

There was an \"absolute crisis\" in the recruitment of statisticians and other social science experts, the Commons science and technology committee added. \"Major problems\" are expected over the next 10 years as the social science workforce continues to age, it said. The committee was reporting on the work, strategy and spending plans of the Economic Social Research Council. The council aims to promote and support strategic research for social science postgraduates and provide social scientists to meet the needs of the country. It also liaises with the government and industry over their social science needs. In its report on the council's work the committee said: \"We are deeply concerned by the skills shortages afflicting, in particular, the qualitative branches of social sciences. This mirrored previous concerns the committee had expressed on shortages in the fields of maths and chemistry, it said. \"It is hard to see how significant progress towards rectifying these shortages can be made through the deployment of Economic and Social Research Council's limited resources. \"If the government is serious about addressing skills shortages in key subjects it needs to find a more effective mechanism to achieve this.\" A national \"strategic capabilities fund\" to address shortages in key areas should be set up in response, the committee added.  \n",

The agreement by the G8 group of wealthy nations would save affected countries 3bn pounds a year, he said. The deal is thought to have been hammered out on Thursday night after Japan, one of the biggest creditor nations, finally signed up to it. Mr Brown first proposed the idea earlier this week. G8 ministers are also believed to have agreed to instruct the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to complete a country by country analysis of the reconstruction problems faced by all states hit by the disaster. Mr Brown has been locked in talks with finance ministers of the G8, which Britain now chairs. Germany also proposed a freeze and Canada has begun its own moratorium. The expected deal comes as Foreign Secretary Jack Straw said the number of Britons dead or missing in the disaster have reached 440.  \n",

Prince Edward will also join the UK delegation in Poland for National Holocaust Memorial Day on 27 January. Between 1.1 and 1.5 million people, mainly Jews, were killed at Auschwitz. The Tories said they were glad Mr Straw had been \"shamed\" into going, having earlier criticised the decision to send a lower-ranking official. Shadow Foreign Secretary Michael Ancram said: \"I am glad the foreign secretary has finally been shamed into representing Britain at this important act of commemoration. \"Once again this government has shown crass insensitivity until it has been forced by public opinion into doing what it should have done in the first place.\" In Britain, the Queen and Prince Philip will lead the nation's commemoration at a service in Westminster Hall, London. The Queen will also host a reception for holocaust survivors at St James's Palace. Altogether, some six million people, mainly Jews, perished in the Holocaust. The Queen's grandson, Prince Harry, sparked outrage earlier this week after photographs of him wearing a Nazi uniform at a costume party emerged. The prince, 20, apologised, but critics have called for him to go to Auschwitz for the commemoration of the Soviets' 1945 liberation of the camp. Prince Harry should see for himself \"the results of the hated symbol he so foolishly and brazenly chose to wear\", Rabbi Marvin Hier, founder of Jewish human rights group the Simon Wiesenthal Center said.  \n",
      "18  Drink remark 'acts as diversion' The first minister's statement that it was okay to get drunk \"once in a while\" has diverted attention from the real issues, it has been claimed. Jack Law, chief executive of Alcohol Focus Scotland, said Jack McConnell's comment was \"ill-advised\". The media attention had helped to move the focus from Scotland's binge drinking problems, Mr Law said. Scotsman journalist Hamish MacDonell said he believed the bigger picture had been \"obscured\" by the remark. Mr McConnell was speaking on Monday to more than 100 secondary pupils from schools in the Highlands about the problems of binge drinking and drink promotions. The one-sentence comment was immediately criticised by the Scottish National Party which accused him of encouraging young people to get drunk. But the Scottish Executive has insisted Mr McConnell was speaking about adults and his comments were \"a recognition that people will get drunk\". Mr MacDonell, political editor of The Scotsman, said: \"I think we have to say right at the outset that this was a very stupid and ill-advised remark by the first minister. \"If you come out with something like this, saying that by all means get drunk, then you will be pilloried for it.\" However, he added that \"perhaps Mr McConnell could feel rightly aggrieved about the coverage\". Mr MacDonell said: \"I think the problem here is that he did say a lot more things about binge drinking and under age drinking. \"But that whole side of things has been lost in the furore over one sentence. I understand why, but I think there is a much bigger message here that has been obscured.\" Mr Law, from voluntary body Alcohol Focus Scotland, believed damage had been done to Scotland's fight against binge drinking. He said he accepted that young people drank and they did have problems with drink. Mr Law added: \"I think the remark was ill-advised - but these remarks are blown out of all proportion and they so easily misrepresent what we are trying to do in Scotland. \"We don't want to preach to young people, but we need to acknowledge that they do drink problematically. \"This diverts us from the real issues which are about promoting responsibility and reducing harm and indeed tackling our drinking culture which is a culture about binge drinking and drunkenness.\" He said it was vital that young people were properly informed about the risks incurred to themselves and others when they got drunk. Mr MacDonell said that the first minister should know by now that if he said things which were \"off the mark\", they were bound to \"come back and bite him\". He added: \"Here, Mr McConnell was talking in the Highlands to 100 teenagers and every word he said was put out on a webcast by the Scottish Executive and then looked at by other politicians and reporters. \"I think in this instance he has done a lot of really good things and he will be regretting this remark.\" The Scottish National Party's Holyrood leader Nicola Sturgeon wrote to Mr McConnell on Tuesday accusing him of an error of judgement and calling for him to apologise for his \"ill-judged comment\" and withdraw it immediately. In a furious response, the first minister said his comments had been distorted and taken out of context. He told Ms Sturgeon: \"It is disappointing that you have contributed to this distortion by saying it is staggering that I 'should encourage young people to get drunk'. \"That is completely untrue. Perhaps it would have been wiser for you to find out what was actually said before you rushed to represent my position, undermine the convener of education at Highland Council and insult the intelligence of the young people I spoke with - all for the sake of a simple soundbite.\"  \n",

The government's response to the plan for a four-tier diploma to replace all existing 14-19 qualifications is expected next week. Some are worried it could be scuppered if, as Tony Blair and Ruth Kelly have suggested, GCSEs and A-levels stay. Sir Mike Tomlinson himself was briefed only this week. He is said to be feeling more comfortable about what the government is likely to say than if he had read only what was in newspapers in the earlier part of the week. But the government was said to be still rewriting its response on Friday. \"It will be a tragedy if the government comes through with a half-hearted response,\" said the chairman of the Commons education select committee, Labour MP Barry Sheerman. His main concern was the reports that there would be a diploma - but only to replace existing vocational qualifications. \"We must tackle head-on the structural mess that is our secondary education system,\" he wrote in the Times Educational Supplement. \"It is not the case that the academic stream in secondary is fine while the vocational route is desperately weak.\" The Qualifications and Curriculum Authority (QCA) has also told the government not to \"compromise\". The QCA said the potential \"step-change in participation and attainment\" lay in the integrity of the whole diploma. \"Any partial implementation of the proposals would, in our view, compromise that integrity,\" said its chairman, Sir Anthony Greener. It is a sign of the QCA's concern that its advice went to ministers last December but was publicised only recently. But people understand that a White Paper response is government policy and has to command wider ministerial support than if it were coming only from the Department for Education and Skills. They may be content if it does not \"close too many doors\" in writing - whatever spin is put on it. The chief inspector of schools, David Bell, also said recently that GCSEs and A-levels should go. \"One of the reasons why I'm so strongly in favour of these terms disappearing over time is that it's good for the symbols of change to be seen right across the system,\" he said. \"If we don't say this is a sea-change in education, we will miss a great opportunity.\" Universities and head teachers in both the independent and state sectors have also backed the Tomlinson proposals, which include having higher grades at advanced level to differentiate between the brightest students. A note of concern has been expressed repeatedly by the employers' organisation, the CBI, which complains of a lack of skills. In an attempt to address this, the Tomlinson plan is for tests in \"functional\" maths and literacy - decidedly not GCSEs. It has been suggested the government will take steps of some sort to meet firms' concerns on this score. Another dissenter is Sir Mike Tomlinson's predecessor as chief schools inspector, Professor Chris Woodhead, who has said there is no need for such a \"massive upheaval\". The Conservative Party has put forward plans to revert to a system of having only the brightest percentage of students each year getting the top A-level grade, no matter how well the others have done.  \n"
